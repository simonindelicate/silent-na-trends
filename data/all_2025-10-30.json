We sat down and spoke to him all things peach and this is what he had to say 👇⁠\n⁠\nWhy he loves it:⁠\n“It’s a fun, juicy flavour that makes people excited to drink AF beer. Refreshing, balanced — and perfect any time of day.”⁠\n⁠\nWhy it works:⁠\n“Our new Days Lager is super crisp, which lets the peach shine. It’s got that jammy sweetness and a hint of citrus that just works.”⁠\n⁠\nWas it tough to make?⁠\n“We trialled over 50 versions to get the sweetness just right — juicy upfront, beer character on the finish.”⁠\n⁠\nWhat’s next?⁠\n“I’ve got a few new ideas brewing… the next release is locked in and it’s a flavour you’ll recognise, but with a brand new twist on Lager.” 👀",

Chmielowość delikatna, lekko cytrusowa, goryczka niska. \n\nNew England DIPA Non-Alcoholic (brak informacji o chmielach). Wyraźnie cytrusowe z nutą białych winogron w aromacie.

    "text": "Nirvana Cloudy Lemon Lager - Just like Clausthaler Grapefruit, Nirvana Cloudy Lemon Lager is a 50/50 beverage - half lager and half fruit drink, making this a shandy. I like lager. I like cloudy lemonade. However, I wouldn’t rush to put the two together, so does this work? In honesty, I really enjoyed this non-alcohol fruit beer/lager/shandy. The lager in this beverage is the famous Nirvana Helles, and it’s been combined with cloudy lemonade which makes this a very, very citrusy beverage, with the lemonade dominating the flavour (unsurprisingly). The aftertaste is the only place you can really taste the lager, but it’s a pleasant and refreshing combo. While I wouldn’t rush to have Nirvana Cloudy Lemon Lager again, I certainly wouldn’t say no if somebody was to get me one. For this drink to score higher, the alcoholic element (the lager) must have a more dominant flavour. In reality, it’s weak, and the shandy is far more like an unusual-tasting cloudy lemonade, rather than a balanced combination of beer and fruit. \n\nRating - 6.5/10\n\n#DryButFly #AlcoholFreeBeer #NonAlcoholicBeer #AlcoholFree #AFBeer #Sober #NoBooze #NoHangover #Beer #Lager #IPA #Stout #PaleAle #Pilsner #Review #AF #Nirvana #NirvanaCloudyLemonLager #NirvanaLager #FruitBeer",

    "text": "Nirvana Nitro Stout (ABV 0.5%) - With Guinness Zero being the only stout I’ve reviewed before this one (scoring a perfect 10/10), Nirvana Nitro Stout was already facing an uphill task to impress. Starting with the pour, there wasn’t much life and no sign of a creamy Guinness-like head. Not to worry. Not all stouts are like Guinness. However, I immediately noticed the “thinness” of this beverage. Upon the first sip, I’d agree with Nirvana’s “velvety” description, but it definitely lacks depth and certainly can’t be described as creamy (IMO). I’ve never been a huge stout fan because of the smell and Nirvana Nitro Stout certainly resembles the aromas of a true stout, so well done to the brewers! It also tastes like a stout (be it a weak one) and you can pick out the coffee. Overall, I am impressed with this drink and I think I prefer it to some of the alcoholic stouts I’ve had in the past. It’s a great effort, and while it has noticeable differences from a “proper” stout, mainly less going on pour-wise, texture-wise and flavour-wise, I liked it and have rated accordingly. For a non-alcoholic beer, it is more than just a watered down attempt!\n\nRating - 7/10\n\n#DryButFly #AlcoholFreeBeer #NonAlcoholicBeer #AlcoholFree #AFBeer #Sober #NoBooze #NoHangover #Beer #Lager #IPA #Stout #PaleAle #Pilsner #Review #AF #Nirvana #NirvanaNitroStout #NitroStout #Nitro",

    "text": "Clausthaler Grapefruit - So, what do we have here then?! An alcohol free beer which is orangey/pinky with “grapefruit” slapped on the side. I like beer. I like grapefruit. But does this work? I’ve put Clausthaler Grapefruit down as a fruit beer but it’s actually a shandy - 50% non-alcoholic beer and 50% “grapefruit”. When pouring - it was just like pouring Fanta Fruit Twist. It smelt fruity and had a lot of life, only for the head to disappear within a matter of seconds. I’ll be honest, this was no surprise. Taste wise - it’s actually really pleasant. 99% of the taste profile is grapefruit and other citrus fruits, and it’s refreshing and goes down a treat. The “non-alcoholic” beer taste is most prominent in the aftertaste, which is very fresh and left me wanting more and more. I like this. It’s very refreshing. Tastes great. However, it’s as much of a “beer” as a golf cart is a car (IMO). I can’t score this too highly based on the fact I’m searching for authentic-tasting AF beers that taste like the real deal. This doesn’t. Still, I’d happily order some more and I imagine it’d taste even fresher on a hot summers day. \n\nRating - 6.5/10\n\n#DryButFly #AlcoholFreeBeer #NonAlcoholicBeer #AlcoholFree #AFBeer #Sober #NoBooze #NoHangover #Beer #Lager #IPA #Stout #PaleAle #Pilsner #Review #AF #Clausthaler #Grapefruit #FruitBeer #Shandy",

    "text": "Queer Brewing – Ponyboy Pale Ale – 0.5%\n\nFrom East London, England\n@queerbrewing were very welcoming when I dropped in unannounced earlier this year, and you can tell a lot about a brewery’s attitude to alcohol-free beer by how their staff talk about it. At Queer Brewing that day there was genuine excitement about the imminent release of a new AF beer. This is the next one, and it has a brilliant can design — a contender for best-looking can of the year.\n\nIt’s brewed with New Zealand hops — Nectaron and Wai-Iti. The former I know well; the latter, less so. Queer Brewing’s AF beers always have an interesting twist, so I had high hopes here.\n\nThis pours a hazy straw colour with a white head that disappears a little quickly. The nose is bold and bright with lashings of peach and a hint of pineapple.\n\nIt begins with a bracing dryness and an assertive bitter note that, for a moment, had me worried we were heading into hop burn territory — but happily it eases back as a gentle fruity note takes over. Then come the good tropical notes again — peach and pineapple — but also a slightly earthy, herbal quality that gives this a welcome dank edge. The finish draws tight as the bitterness re-emerges, providing a satisfying sense of closure — a proper full stop.\n\nSometimes New Zealand hops bring all the tropical fruit party notes but not much complexity; here there’s definitely more going on beyond just fruitiness.\nThis is a great example of a full-flavoured pale that delivers interest and balance in equal measure. I really enjoyed it — and I love how the can’s mad, brilliant design fits the beer’s character perfectly.\n\n88/100\n\n#nabeer #alcoholfree #alcoholfreeworld #afbeer #beer #alcoholfreedrinks",

    "text": "A. Le Coq – Beer Mail Alcohol-Free IPA – 0.0%\n\nA. Le Coq, @elusonmaitset, is from Tartu, Estonia — the oldest brewery there, with roots going back to 1807. I’ve been working through their fruited AF beers recently, and now it’s time for something more conventional: an alcohol-free IPA.\n\nThe label features a Captain Haddock / Captain Birdseye-type character (depending on your cultural references) and celebrates “Beer Mail” — which happens to be one of my favourite things.\n\nThis pours mid-gold in the glass with a buoyant white foamy head. The nose is pine resin and marmalade with a distinctly West Coast feel. The label confirms it’s hopped with Chinook, Amarillo, Cascade, and Citra, so that tracks perfectly.\n\nThis beer grabs your attention with a very assertive initial bitterness carried on a sweet-feeling mouthfeel that drives that bitterness through the body as some contrasting sweeter malt notes develop. The bitter backbone never strays far, and the crisp finish is essentially that bitterness left behind once the other flavours fade.\n\nFor a 0.0% ABV beer from a macro brewery, this is a remarkably full-flavoured beer. Many serious craft breweries would be proud to make a West Coast IPA this good.\n\n86/100\n\n#fitlife #beerme #HealthyEating #nabeer #sobercurious #wellnessjourney #mindfuldrinking #craftbeer #nearbeer #beerlovers #alcoholfreeworld #beergeek #alcoholfree #nadrinks",

    "text": "Jump/Ship – Ocean Drift Bramble Sour – 0.5%\n\nFrom Edinburgh, Scotland\n@jumpshipbeer go from strength to strength — and one way I can tell is that I’m always a couple of beers behind in reviewing them. I have their latest release on my wish list already, but this bramble sour was one I didn’t want to miss when it was released earlier this summer.\n\nIn the glass, as I’d expect from a blackcurrant and blackberry beer, this one is a hazy, mid-to-dark red which looks rich rather than like cherryade, especially with the crown of white foam which, although not long-lasting, remains as a fine halo. The nose is quite muted with just a hint of fruit — I’m drinking this fridge-cold, which is how I like fruited sours, though aroma can be livelier closer to room temperature.\n\nThis is really nice. Over 2,000 beer reviews in and I start this one with a bland statement like that — but let me explain. It’s high praise for a fruit sour because I don’t always get such a positive first impression. It begins with a nice prickle of carbonation which combines with a semi-assertive but not aggressive sour note that braces the mouth for the fruit flavours as they arrive. I can clearly pick out two red fruits: a sharper blackberry first, then a richer blackcurrant that lingers through to the finish. There’s also a hint of tannin and almost a touch of oakiness.\n\nMy favourite beers are about transitions — the sensations that unfold as you drink. I can enjoy a beer without analysis (Corona Cero, for example), but the joy of a good beer is that it takes you on a taste journey. That’s exactly what this beer does, and what some simpler fruit sours don’t quite manage. The interplay of the two fruit flavours, the balanced sourness, and the elongated profile together make this a real standout.\n\nI haven’t checked my archive to see previous scores, but I’m calling this my favourite of Jump Ship’s beers.\n\n87/100\n\n#nabeer #alcoholfree #alcoholfreeworld #afbeer #beer #alcoholfreedrinks #jumpshipbeer #jumpshipbrewing #edinburgh",

    "text": "A. Le Coq – Fass-Brause Lemon – 0.0%\n\nA. Le Coq, @elusonmaitset, is from Tartu, Estonia — the oldest brewery there, with roots going back to 1807 and a Prussian business importing imperial stouts brewed in London. It’s a long way from imperial stouts to lemon-flavoured alcohol-free beers.\n\nThis is a very pale straw colour with a lemony tinge and a rich white foamy head. Sometimes a fruited macro beer just doesn’t look right, but this one passes the eye test. The nose is fresh and lemony.\n\nThis is a rather one-dimensional, if delicious, lemon-flavoured drink. The lemon isn’t especially artificial or overly sweet — I think it’s pitched just right. There’s a reason lemon beers work so well and are so widespread: the lemon flavour complements beer flavour so well that, as millions of lager-top drinkers used to testify, there’s just something delicious about beer with that hint of lemon. Here, however, the needle is pushed far beyond “hint of” and squarely into lemony soft-drink territory.\n\nSuper easy to drink and nice enough — but not layered enough to be a great example of the genre.\n\n64/100\n\n#fitlife #beerme #HealthyEating #nabeer #sobercurious #wellnessjourney #mindfuldrinking #craftbeer #nearbeer #beerlovers #alcoholfreeworld #beergeek #alcoholfree #nadrinks",

    "text": "Queer Brewing – Ponyboy Pale Ale – 0.5%\n\nFrom East London, England\n@queerbrewing were very welcoming when I dropped in unannounced earlier this year, and you can tell a lot about a brewery’s attitude to alcohol-free beer by how their staff talk about it. At Queer Brewing that day there was genuine excitement about the imminent release of a new AF beer. This is the next one, and it has a brilliant can design — a contender for best-looking can of the year.\n\nIt’s brewed with New Zealand hops — Nectaron and Wai-Iti. The former I know well; the latter, less so. Queer Brewing’s AF beers always have an interesting twist, so I had high hopes here.\n\nThis pours a hazy straw colour with a white head that disappears a little quickly. The nose is bold and bright with lashings of peach and a hint of pineapple.\n\nIt begins with a bracing dryness and an assertive bitter note that, for a moment, had me worried we were heading into hop burn territory — but happily it eases back as a gentle fruity note takes over. Then come the good tropical notes again — peach and pineapple — but also a slightly earthy, herbal quality that gives this a welcome dank edge. The finish draws tight as the bitterness re-emerges, providing a satisfying sense of closure — a proper full stop.\n\nSometimes New Zealand hops bring all the tropical fruit party notes but not much complexity; here there’s definitely more going on beyond just fruitiness.\nThis is a great example of a full-flavoured pale that delivers interest and balance in equal measure. I really enjoyed it — and I love how the can’s mad, brilliant design fits the beer’s character perfectly.\n\n88/100\n\n#nabeer #alcoholfree #alcoholfreeworld #afbeer #beer #alcoholfreedrinks",

    "text": "Nirvana Cloudy Lemon Lager - Just like Clausthaler Grapefruit, Nirvana Cloudy Lemon Lager is a 50/50 beverage - half lager and half fruit drink, making this a shandy. I like lager. I like cloudy lemonade. However, I wouldn’t rush to put the two together, so does this work? In honesty, I really enjoyed this non-alcohol fruit beer/lager/shandy. The lager in this beverage is the famous Nirvana Helles, and it’s been combined with cloudy lemonade which makes this a very, very citrusy beverage, with the lemonade dominating the flavour (unsurprisingly). The aftertaste is the only place you can really taste the lager, but it’s a pleasant and refreshing combo. While I wouldn’t rush to have Nirvana Cloudy Lemon Lager again, I certainly wouldn’t say no if somebody was to get me one. For this drink to score higher, the alcoholic element (the lager) must have a more dominant flavour. In reality, it’s weak, and the shandy is far more like an unusual-tasting cloudy lemonade, rather than a balanced combination of beer and fruit. \n\nRating - 6.5/10\n\n#DryButFly #AlcoholFreeBeer #NonAlcoholicBeer #AlcoholFree #AFBeer #Sober #NoBooze #NoHangover #Beer #Lager #IPA #Stout #PaleAle #Pilsner #Review #AF #Nirvana #NirvanaCloudyLemonLager #NirvanaLager #FruitBeer",

    "text": "Nirvana Nitro Stout (ABV 0.5%) - With Guinness Zero being the only stout I’ve reviewed before this one (scoring a perfect 10/10), Nirvana Nitro Stout was already facing an uphill task to impress. Starting with the pour, there wasn’t much life and no sign of a creamy Guinness-like head. Not to worry. Not all stouts are like Guinness. However, I immediately noticed the “thinness” of this beverage. Upon the first sip, I’d agree with Nirvana’s “velvety” description, but it definitely lacks depth and certainly can’t be described as creamy (IMO). I’ve never been a huge stout fan because of the smell and Nirvana Nitro Stout certainly resembles the aromas of a true stout, so well done to the brewers! It also tastes like a stout (be it a weak one) and you can pick out the coffee. Overall, I am impressed with this drink and I think I prefer it to some of the alcoholic stouts I’ve had in the past. It’s a great effort, and while it has noticeable differences from a “proper” stout, mainly less going on pour-wise, texture-wise and flavour-wise, I liked it and have rated accordingly. For a non-alcoholic beer, it is more than just a watered down attempt!\n\nRating - 7/10\n\n#DryButFly #AlcoholFreeBeer #NonAlcoholicBeer #AlcoholFree #AFBeer #Sober #NoBooze #NoHangover #Beer #Lager #IPA #Stout #PaleAle #Pilsner #Review #AF #Nirvana #NirvanaNitroStout #NitroStout #Nitro",

This AF beer has definite tropical fruit vibes and offers the zero drinker a juicy mouthful, but my can did not offer up much body or head when poured. While it was a refreshing and flavourful accompaniment to my curry, I’ve enjoyed better zero pales, of which the craft market is well stocked with excellent options.\n\nAvailable from: @farmyardbrewco \n\n#lowalcohol #paleale #beer #afbeer #nabeer #zerobeer #alcoholfreebeer #lancaster #brewery",

    "text": "Clausthaler Grapefruit - So, what do we have here then?! An alcohol free beer which is orangey/pinky with “grapefruit” slapped on the side. I like beer. I like grapefruit. But does this work? I’ve put Clausthaler Grapefruit down as a fruit beer but it’s actually a shandy - 50% non-alcoholic beer and 50% “grapefruit”. When pouring - it was just like pouring Fanta Fruit Twist. It smelt fruity and had a lot of life, only for the head to disappear within a matter of seconds. I’ll be honest, this was no surprise. Taste wise - it’s actually really pleasant. 99% of the taste profile is grapefruit and other citrus fruits, and it’s refreshing and goes down a treat. The “non-alcoholic” beer taste is most prominent in the aftertaste, which is very fresh and left me wanting more and more. I like this. It’s very refreshing. Tastes great. However, it’s as much of a “beer” as a golf cart is a car (IMO). I can’t score this too highly based on the fact I’m searching for authentic-tasting AF beers that taste like the real deal. This doesn’t. Still, I’d happily order some more and I imagine it’d taste even fresher on a hot summers day. \n\nRating - 6.5/10\n\n#DryButFly #AlcoholFreeBeer #NonAlcoholicBeer #AlcoholFree #AFBeer #Sober #NoBooze #NoHangover #Beer #Lager #IPA #Stout #PaleAle #Pilsner #Review #AF #Clausthaler #Grapefruit #FruitBeer #Shandy",

Therefore, I am extremely disappointed to write that this AF Pilsner is no good! The pour was non-eventful. It poured rather flat, despite carbonation pretty evident with every sip. However, I guess you could argue that the most important element of a drink is taste. Warsteiner Premium Fresh really doesn’t have much flavour at all. I know I sound like a broken record, but it truly tastes like a watered down beer, like so many of the poorer alcohol free beers out there. It’s a perfectly pleasant drink, and yes, I could have plenty. However, is it a decent alcohol free beer? In my opinion – no, because it simply doesn’t have enough taste to resemble a beer.\n\nRating - 3/10\n\n#DryButFly #AlcoholFreeBeer #NonAlcoholicBeer #AlcoholFree #AFBeer #Sober #NoBooze #NoHangover #Beer #Lager #IPA #Stout #PaleAle #Pilsner #Review #AF #Warsteiner #WarsteinerPremiumFresh #PremiumFresh",

Time for another entry from the Gang, with what feels like the spiritual successor to one of the best AF stouts I've ever tried, Reign In Blood. Lets see how this one fares 👀\n\nThe nose certainly does a lot here - there's a rich and creamy base of chocolate and vanilla, with a delightful cherry poking through sweet with a pinch of sourness at the back. The palate follows this template, with a malt base bringing a lil bitterness that complements the sour from the cherry, with the rest of the elements building a genuine cherry cake profile. It's presented really well and topped off with a smooth body and silky mouthfeel.\n\nSo yeah, this one is a banger. The perfect beer to follow a roast after a busy weekend. Might see if I can grab a few more of these before it goes forever! So, Mash Gang... more veeg cakey stouts soon? Cheers everyone 🃏🍻\n\n#veganbeerreview #mashgang #englishbeer #ukbeer #ukcraftbeer #pastrystout #dessertstout #stout #darkbeer #alcoholfreestout #alcoholfreebeer #afbeer #lowandno #veganalcoholfree #veganstout #veganbeer #vegancraftbeer #craftbeer #beerreview #craftbeerreview #beerstagram #beeroclock #craftbeerlife #beeroftheday #beertography #stoutsunday",

WOO von @bevog_brewery ist ein alkoholfreies Hoppy Lager, eingebraut mit nur  0,3 Vol.-% Alk., aber einer ordentlichen Portion Hopfen!\nHelles Gold, leicht opak, und feiner, weißer Schaum. In der Nase hopfig und fruchtig. Schon beim Antrunk, der herrlich erfrischend ist, hopfenbetont. Der schlanke Körper wirkt voller, als er bei einem AF sein kann. Zum fruchtigen Hopfencharakter kommt eine feine, knackige Bittere, die zusammen mit dem trockenen Abgang dafür sorgt, dass man gleich Lust auf den nächsten Schluck bekommt. Hoppy - Sober - Fun. Vielen Dank @probiertv für dieses tolle alkoholfreie Bier. Cheers und Ahoi! 🍻 \n.\n.\n\n#BevogBrewery #Bevog #WOO #AlkoholfreieHoppyLager #NonalcoholicHoppyLager\n#AlkoholfreiesBier #Alcoholfreebeer #DiplomBiersommelier #CertifiedBeersommelier\n#Biersommelier #Beersommelier #Bier #Beer #Craftbier #Craftbeer #SchlossMickinik #CastleMickinik #Bierverkostung #Beertasting #BiersommelierDominik #Dermenschlebtnichtvombrotallein #mandoesnotlivebybreadallone #Hopfenundmalzgotterhalts #Inhopsandmaltwetrust #Armleuchterstil #Ahmidudestyle #Sonntagsbier #Sundaybeer #ProbierTV #Beermail",

    "text": "Half way through Sober October!\n\nA lot of people have asked me two questions. \n\nWhy? Well, why not? I have been focusing hard on running this year and being in the best physical shape I can. I don’t believe that my alcohol consumption was necessarily holding back my success as I have managed to continually and consistently drop weight and run longer distances, faster. With that said, I was more so just curious to see if it would make a difference. \n\nThat leads me into the second question. Have you noticed a difference? I will admit I am sleeping significantly better. Being well rested plays a massive role in recovery and I do believe it is making me a stronger runner. I have also noticed a slight change in my body. I have managed to lose 70 pounds this year and I have noticed over the last couple weeks my skin is starting to firm up a bit and I am seeing some definition around my muscles. Now, I don’t know for sure if that is the absence of alcohol or just consistency doing its works but either way I am happy with the results. \n\nNot drinking has not stopped me for going out, having fun with my friends at bars, breweries, parties, etc. The majority of the run clubs I participate in meet and end at breweries. Many places offer up NA options such as hop water, house-made sodas, and NA beers. \n\nAs an added bonus, while my weight is down, my bank account is looking a little heavier! \n\nPictured:\n@reformationbrewery Cola. \n@variantbrewingcompany Hop Pop Hop Water\n@hornedowlbrewing HOB Tangerine Hop Water\n\n.\n.\n.\n#sober #soberoctober #nonalcoholic #nabeverages #zeroproof #alcholfree #homemadesoda #cola #hopwater #fitness #weightloss #weightlossjourney #healthyliving #nonalcoholicbeer #nonalcoholicdrink #mocktail #sleep #rest #recovery #runclub",

It's a 9.5% Hazy Imperial IPA but has that touch of sweetness that is pretty radical compared to most bitter IPAs. If you're looking for something enjoyable that at the same time, will get you f*cked, it's gotta be this. Let me know what y'all think, or if there are more beers I have yet to try.

This also happens in some cases when they use tall glasses, and basically they create a new round of foam after the initial pour.</p> <p>I know how to replicate this event, and I (think I) know the physical explanation.

    "text": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I was thinking something like brown ale or maybe amber ale. My reasoning is that, from what I assume, it should be less technically demanding than any type of lager. Also those are more malt-forward styles and choosing a style which enables you to focus mostly on one ingredient, without worrying extensively about other additional flavour notes, comming from yeast or hopps seems to make the most sense at the beginning. And since malt is the backbone of any kind of beer I think it should take priority.

Starting to become a real issue in the relationship. I do not want to give up on my beer-drinking routine, but I also do not want someone else suffering because of it 🙂 I tried washing my teeth 2-3 times, chewing-gums before bedtime, mouth washing fluids (not a big fan of those tho), she says not much helps, always the same in the morning and in general. Question is - did someone manage to find a way to neutralise it (the smell of alcohol in general), and how do you (drinking-enthusiasts) manage those situations?

I am hoping somebody can tell me if that is a Keykeg or not? Also, there is a huge warning about depressurization immediately after the keg is empty and its dangers - the Keykeg kegs don't have any such warning or procedure. Is that really such a big deal? It is just breaking off the red part on the valve, right? What can happen there? The warning just makes it seem really scary and dangerous, without giving any information on what can happen or what to expect. Also, why does it need to happen immediately after emptying the keg? Couldn't you do it the next day?</p> <p>Thanks for any tips!

It’s a painting type of artwork on the can. The name had to do something with ocean (maybe)?</p> <p>If this information helps any, I live in the Carolinas. I couldn’t tell you if it was locally made but it was in the seasonal beer section..</p> <p>Anybody have a clue as to what I might be talking about? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/nvves\"> /u/nvves </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1ofj1dd/trying_to_find_a_beer_i_had_years_ago/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1ofj1dd/trying_to_find_a_beer_i_had_years_ago/\">[comments]</a></span>",

The reality is that finding one in the wild where I am is like finding a unicorn. The one brand I tried, Old Speckled Hen, was alright, not life changing but subtle, unique, pleasant and probably very sessionable.

When I attend conventions there is so much centered around alcohol for the social hours. I do not drink much alcohol (rarely) yet I want to participate in some of the social gatherings without feeling left out. I know there are many others who also feel this way.</p> <p>B. I have mentioned to people about how their fairs should offer mocktails in their beer gardens. Most have told me &quot;that will not bring in the revenue&quot; and I disagree. For one, if you aren't drinking beer you are either not in the beer garden, or you are going out of the beer garden to get soda, lemonade, etc. and I think people would be willing to pay &quot;alcohol&quot; prices for premium mocktails and NA drinks and stay within the 21+ areas.</p> <p>C. I will be hosting a mocktail experience at my trade show room next month and want to share the importance of this with people who are planning large-scale events. I also want to give out a few samples of these drinks for those who are sober.</p> <p>D. I want to create a short e-book on how to add this experience to your event and how it can help improve revenue as well as attendance.</p> <p>Am I wishful thinking here? Is any of this possible?

Imagine my joy when I saw this one in my local B&amp;M for a tenner for the gift set...I had to have it. Is it good though? Let's find out.</p> <p>Invincible pours a nice deep gold colour, slightly hazy, with a loose white head. The aroma is sweet citrus and tropical, with plenty of it to boot. The body is light to medium with high levels of vibrant carbonation. The flavour is wonderful, bitter, hoppy, with a citrus twist and a subtle pineapple suggestion to finish it off. It's well balanced with the hops and bitterness, something that makes me very happy. On the back end is where the bitterness really shines, it's slightly resinous and piney, and it's here where that lays roots on your tongue, lasting for a good time.</p> <p>So yes, this is a corker of a beer, with bags of flavour and an aggressive carbonation, much like the riffage in your typical JP track. The only thing I'd change is the body, and that would be to make it as heavy as Priest's music, but that's a tough ask for any alcohol free beer. 4.6/5 from me, with a buy again and value for money bonus. Now, off to see if I can buy the beer on its own.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/All-Hail-The-Ale\"> /u/All-Hail-The-Ale </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://youtube.com/watch?v=eQ-Q5ySVX7Q&amp;si=NC6l7h8Rr9h-aq1V\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nonalcoholic/comments/1nx60ss/williams_bros_x_judas_priest_invincible_af_ipa/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>",

While this isn’t an apples-to-apples comparison with real bourbons, Kentucky 74 Spiced comes surprisingly close. Spiritless labels it as a cinnamon whiskey, but it’s not the candy-cinnamon-forward style you get in Fireball or similar products. Instead, it aligns more with bourbons that feature woodsy cinnamon notes layered into a balanced profile.</p> <p>Tasting Notes:</p> <ul> <li>Charred Oak - Oak and Smoke</li> <li>Vanilla - rounded sweetness</li> <li>Caramel</li> <li>Warm Baking Spices <ul> <li>Woodsy Cinnamon Bite - noticeable but not overpowering</li> <li>Clove - adds depth and warmth</li> <li>Maybe some Nutmeg and Allspice, but subtle</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p>Overall, Kentucky 74 Spiced is well-balanced and harmonious, with its spice and sweetness seamlessly layered over a foundation of oak and vanilla.

The mezcal part adds this chill smoky undertone—not super strong, just enough to notice. And there’s a little sweetness and spice on the finish that pulls it all together. Doesn’t taste like soda, doesn’t taste like juice. It’s got that legit cocktail vibe. Layered. Adult.

Very refreshing on a hot summer day after mowing the lawn (or climbing a 1,500-year-old pyramid).</p> <p>Anyway I was already a fan of Best Day's Electro-Lime, which is similar, but lately I am preferring the Go Brewing Salty AF Chelada. </p> <p>Both are thirst-quenching and agreeably tart.

I wanted to update it, and thought I would crowd source in case I'm missing anything - I've ranked Kava Haven as the best, followed by Sentia, Dromme and bonbuz. I did include a few cbd-mocktails because it's technically still a buzz without alcohol. Any suggestions on new stuff out there that actually makes you feel something? (note: when I say buzz, I mean body buzz and not head buzz). Thanks everyone!<br /> (P.S.

We keep getting stuck in this brutal loop: we’ll spend a few days motivated, committed to staying sober and crushing health and work goals, and then one day — after long day at work, or a dinner, or hanging with friends, the resolve just evaporates. Before I know it, we're drinking until 2 a.m., waking up hungover, hating myself, and repeating the same thing again.</p> <p>What makes it harder is that I’m not lazy or unambitious. I’m actually building my dream business right now and I want to be firing on all cylinders. But the hangovers wreck my focus and discipline. It’s like I keep clipping my own wings.</p> <p>We recently moved from the U.S. back to South Africa, and part of that transition has been trying to make new friends and rebuild a community which, unfortunately, can often revolve around drinking. Dinners, parties, catchups… alcohol is baked into all of it. But it’s really damaging my marriage. My wife drinks and does drugs as hard as I do, and she’s just as desperate to stop. The addictions have their claws deep in both of us.</p> <p>When we have a night, the whole next day is shot — we lie on the couch, watch TV, eat garbage. It goes against everything I believe in and everything I want for my health, fitness, and career. We’re also more irritable, more easily triggered, and little fights happen way too easily.</p> <p>I just want to find a way out for both of us. To get sober, get healthy again, and feel like our real selves. We tried Sober October and failed. Rehab isn’t an option right now because of work and life commitments. I should add that i also battle with the idea of full sobriety as I do very much enjoy a cold beer on a hot day or a glass of wine at a dinner party with friends..</p> <p>So yeah… I’m stuck.

But you need to be patient. You also don’t “drink through it.” Although it feels that way, the Naltrexone is still working - even if it doesn’t feel like it. </p> <p>See my comment below when I was asked about my experience. I hope this helps even one person! This drug is massively underrated and under utilised but it has the potential to change and potentially save your life. </p> <p>Comment -</p> <p>It took time for sure but I knew I had to stick with it religiously! I took it as per TSM - one tablet one hour before drinking. I recorded my alcohol intake and over time watched it decrease. At about 7 months it started to decrease slowly, my month 8 it was sharply decreased.</p> <p>By that point, I felt absolutely no cravings, no mental obsession, just pure indifference. If alcohol was put in front of me I would gag at the thought of drinking it. Then I started going out and not drinking and it didn’t bother me at all, I could watch people drink and feel absolutely fine with it, they may as well have been drinking water for all I cared!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/LunaValley\"> /u/LunaValley </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ojtr55/my_experience_with_naltrexone/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ojtr55/my_experience_with_naltrexone/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Unrelated to that I went to a little halloween get together thing tonight and we did a little spooky basket type thing where we draw names at random and get that person a little gift basket. The person who got me didnt know I started sobriety and they got me a bottle of wine. Now I used to be a heavy drinker for about 5 years straight. 12-15 drinks a night every night that entire time. On my heavier nights it was easily north of 20 drinks. So to me a bottle of wine is just a starter. This was my first time in 30 days where I was seriously tempted to drink. In my mind I had already justified it and decided id drink it cuz it was free and from a friend and then id start over tomorrow. However a couple of my friends who know about my sobriety immediately were like oh he's not drinking anymore we'll hold on to that. And just like that I avoided the temptation. No arguments simple as that. I really thought it wouldn't be a big deal to have this free bottle of wine but now im glad my friends stepped in for me automatically without me saying a word. I can continue my sobriety onwards. Idek why I shared this really just wanted to share. Good luck this holiday season with all the temptations that come with the season.

It's about 2-3 ounces. I could catch a buzz off it. I could light up that part of my brain that finds relief and joy in alcohol. I could ease any anxiety that pops into my head, maybe for about an hour. But it wouldn't be enough. In an hour I'd feel worse and want more. Need more. Enough to get through the rest of the day. Enough to go to sleep. Too much. </p> <p>That glass of whiskey would make everything worse. I know that if I drink it I've already decided to drink more. Not a drop but a deluge. Failed attempts at sobriety have taught me this much at least. That glass of whiskey holds no appeal. </p> <p>I kind of hope she leaves it there for a while.</p> <p>EDIT: For those urging me to dump it, I get it and I'm not claiming to be impervious. I can certainly fuck up, I've done it before. It's just that it won't be with that drink. There's plenty of temptation around. I walk past my usual liquor store every day. Liquor doesn't go bad, it's covered and perfectly good as glasses of whiskey go. i just know I don't want to drink it by itself. For now it's keeping me honest with myself.

    "text": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello, I’m back now after relapsing last year around April time. I don’t know what to say besides I apologize to the community because I broke a 94 day streak… tomorrow morning at 8am will be the start of day 4 where I was hung over (really hungover) Monday but not drunk. I’m pretty sure I was having withdrawals because I was puking any liquids or food I was putting in me. I’m fully committed this time to quitting. I woke up Monday morning at 5:15am pretty sure still a little buzzed from Sunday night. My eyes shot open and in my brain I told myself that I wanted to live.. I started repeating it over and over again in my head like something snapped in me. I woke my wife up and sobbed like a baby to her… and told her how I was feeling and my epiphany I guess? Tomorrow day 4 will be the longest I’ve went sober in over 1 year. I do have to ask the community… I’m absolutely terrified of what my blood work / liver is gonna be when I go next week to get everything checked….. how can I deal with this stress and anxiety of my future results…. I literally scared they’ll tell me I’m dying….Not to mention I’m sure my alcoholism made my acne very very severe (it is went to a dermatologist in march 2025). And my eyes are having complications…. How can I deal with this stress and anxiety and not let it eat me alive until I know what’s certain ? Any help would be very much appreciated..Please and thank you community….. I’ll make you proud this time…. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Dszz70\"> /u/Dszz70 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ojrm2o/back_again_end_of_day_3/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ojrm2o/back_again_end_of_day_3/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I can’t wait, and I don’t like how I use it as a crutch and in social situations. One issue I have is work travel. I love leaving work at 3, exploring the city, and having a beer. Find a nice outside space or overlooking downtown, beer. And don’t get me started on the airport. About to stick myself in a chair for 3 hours with no arm space coughing, maybe throw in a delayed flight, beer. What else does one ‘do’? I’d really like to try being sober on my next trip. I know it may not sound like a lot, but I had 1 a day and 3 in 3 days makes me feel guilty.

For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!</p> <hr /> <p><strong>This pledge is a statement of intent.</strong> Today we don't set out <em>trying</em> not to drink, we make a conscious decision <em>not to drink</em>. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!</p> <p>What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again.

Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at <a href=\"/r/stopdrinking\">/r/stopdrinking</a> or have followed the pledges from the beginning.</p> <p><strong>What this isn't:</strong> A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories.

Here are a few good ones that I’m sure many others have enjoyed as well. It’s not that I agreed 100% with everything any of them had to say — but I found a lot of useful information, solid science about alcohol and its effects, and inspiration in each of these. I consider them all worth a listen:</p> <pre><code>• This Naked Mind — by Annie Grace • Alcohol Explained — by William Porter </code></pre> <p>I also listened to <strong>What Alcohol Does to Your Body, Brain, and Health</strong>, a podcast episode by Andrew Huberman. It’s about two hours long and available for free on YouTube. I know he also has some shorter excerpts out there, but the full version has a lot of very useful info, in my opinion.</p> <p><strong>IWNDWYT</strong></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/McBenBen\"> /u/McBenBen </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ojqa9o/the_daily_checkin_for_thursday_october_30th_just/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ojqa9o/the_daily_checkin_for_thursday_october_30th_just/\">[comments]</a></span>",

It was mentally challenging , but it made me realise there isnt really a good enough app for quitting addictions , I was thinking of building a sort of gamified app to help quit additions , make it like github contributions. everyday u sustain from the addiction you gain 1 contribution and you keep leveling up your character the higher your contributions etc as well as incorporating a sort of chatbot thats finetuned to motivate you , give you tips , help you quit the addiction and beat the urges whenever they occur because some people dont have an accountability partner and it is a struggle doing it alone . Would you guys ever download and use an app like this ? and what other ideas do you suggest I add to this app to help people who want to get rid of their addictions ? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Hour-Inflation1149\"> /u/Hour-Inflation1149 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ojpsqo/app_to_quit_drinking_advice_needed/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ojpsqo/app_to_quit_drinking_advice_needed/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "Made it 30 Days… Going for 30 More",
    "text": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Here to provide a little perspective and (hopefully) hope for anyone who’s considering taking a break from alcohol. Although I wasn’t a daily drinker I had wine in my fridge for 10+ years and drank 4-5 nights a week. Like many during Covid my consumption increased and my nightly glass of wine turned into 2 or 3 and sometimes a bottle or more. I had a few too many horrible hangover days that I wasted feeling sorry for myself while rotting on the couch or in bed and the hangxiety was overwhelming.</p> <p>Long story short I had a reckoning with myself when I turned 40 and made a list of all of the things I was tired of or wanted to change. Number one was my mental health- my depression and anxiety were at an all-time high, but I also wasn’t sleeping well, I’d gained weight, my skincare wasn’t making any difference and I was generally just unhappy with how routine my life had become. It became clear to me when looking at my list that alcohol was not helping me so I decided to bite the bullet and go alcohol free for 30 days in addition to some other changes.</p> <p>No sugar coating- the first week sucked. I couldn’t really sleep even though I was exhausted, when I did sleep I woke up sweaty and gross, I was super irritable and moody and basically told my poor husband to just avoid me. I completely lost my appetite, was constipated AF and had a 5 day headache. I could not drink enough water to quench my thirst and all I wanted was a tumbler of white wine or a giant martini.</p> <p>Week 2 my mental state was still not great but I could feel my depression abating. Instead of feeling straight dread I was mostly just bored and cranky, my guts started to feel better and with the help of meditation, melatonin and sleepytime tea I was able to get 5 or 6 hours of sleep each night. </p> <p>Week 3 I started de-puffing. Nothing monumental but it was noticeable in both my face and my waist and for sure around my hooded eyes. Still drinking water and herbal teas like crazy but I also learned that putting a mocktail or a spindrift in a fancy glass tricks my dumb brain and kind of satisfied my wine cravings. Sleep continued to improve and I started some gentle workout and stretching routines.</p> <p>Week 4 I went to a friend’s birthday campout where there was a ton of drinking, stayed sober and felt so proud of myself. I had massive anxiety beforehand because I’ve been too ashamed to admit my drinking had gotten out of hand and I was so worried everyone would notice my abstinence. Not one person gave a tiny shit and to be honest I don’t think anyone even noticed I wasn’t boozing. I sipped my La Croixs and phony Negronis and had a great time, especially the following morning when I woke up to go on a morning hike while others were nursing hangovers and headaches. </p> <p>Today is my 30 day mark and tbh the only reason I know that is because I put it in my calendar. I anticipated that when I reached the end of this experiment I’d reward myself with a nice bottle of wine or a night out for martinis… instead I’m going to do another 30 days.</p> <p>I feel 100x better than I did 30 days ago. I still have a shitload of problems (the depression is still there, I need to find another job, money is tight, democracy is falling in the U.S., etc) but everything feels more manageable and just… quieter. My anxiety has reduced so much and I actually crave sleep now- like I start getting excited for bed. </p> <p>It’s definitely not easy and I’ve had to incorporate a number of tools along the way (meditation, supplements, nutrition, NA beverages, quit lit, walking, the list goes on) but this mini journey has been so so worth it. I am more than happy to share more of the excruciating details if anyone’s interested- I’m a list girlie and I’ve got tips and tricks written down for myself all over the place.</p> <p>I don’t know if I’ll stay alcohol free forever, but I’m excited to see what 60 days looks like.

My justification is that since I've been doing well since august by having decent streaks and even when I have drank in between never going overboard.

So far I love it, the writer's style and honesty and the information it provides while bringing to light the things we don't notice are subconciously ingrained in us about alcohol. </p> <p>So for my question - I have not gotten that far in the book, but her main point so far seems to be that people who become alcoholics or who abuse alcohol are not any different than people who don't (physically or mentally).. they are just further along with a highly addictive, harmful substance. </p> <p>The thing that pops in my mind with this is when people esp on this sub say &quot;one is too many, a thousand is never enough&quot;. I feel that way about alcohol because I always want more. I am good to stop at &quot;my point&quot; but I generally drink til I get there or it's not worth it to me. So does this contradict what she is saying? Do you believe you specifically somehow have a predispositioned tendancy to abuse and/or not be able to control it or crave more? Or do you think that happens to someone who has just gone too far down the slippery slope with an addictive substance? </p> <p>I'm sorry if my question doesn't make sense please lmk if I need to clarify. I guess I liked the idea that it can happen to anyone but when I read on here I see people more inclined to believe it is something specific to them or those like them and I value your opinions because I have lurked on this sub for a couple years now. </p> <p>Let me know your thoughts.

I was thinking of booking a trip somewhere to use up some remaining PTO and immediately found them using the local beer as a contributing factor to where I was gonna go.

I sat and thought about that - something, as a frequent traveller, was second nature to me and now - utterly redundant. I don't do that anymore, I CAN'T do that anymore.

I know they aren't for everyone, and personally I cannot do NA beers. But mocktails I love and have been a huge help for me. I was at a fancy dinner the other day, and every course was served with booze. However, the waiter knew I didn't drink, so he made me custom mocktails for it. And they were so tasty! One was very zesty and orange based, another was cauliflower based. It was a very nice gesture, and allowed me to enjoy my dinner while still having a tasty drink AND not having any alcohol. It wasn't the first time I had a mocktail and won't be the last, but it reminded me how thankful I am that there's alternatives to drinking that I enjoy.</p> <p>And shoutout to the waiter who gave me the drinks and made them himself. Julien you'll never see this but you're the man and as a sober person I appreciate you having my back and not making me feel uncomfortable for not drinking. </p> <p>What are you thankful for?</p> <p>IWNDWYT</p> <p>Tom</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/FourDozenEggs\"> /u/FourDozenEggs </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ojo3x4/thankful_thursday_mocktails/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ojo3x4/thankful_thursday_mocktails/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "text": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I composed this Monday morning and didn't post it because I chickened out, and I am a very private person. Tonight, I decided I don't care (I'm not drinking). Be kind. I am doing my best with my situation. I am not a drunk, and I am very functional. But I drink way too much too often to cope. I never miss my kids' stuff, and I always attend every game and appointment, etc. If we have something to do, I don't care if I drink. I am never just like, &quot;I can't wait to drink&quot; or &quot;I wish I was at home so I can drink.&quot; When I get home late from a game or event, I don't drink. If I do, it's only a few. Doesn't matter; I know I have a problem. I want to get counseling, but I don't want my wife to know. I can't really do it without her knowing. I never want her to think I'm not her hero. I feel about 1,000 times better than I did Monday, and it wasn't &quot;hangxiety.&quot; I drank normally on Sunday. Just see below. Let me know your thoughts, and please be kind.</p> <p>↓↓↓↓↓ </p> <p>I'm so sad/depressed today; I literally can't work. I can work even if I am hungover, which isn't that often nowadays. I guess I'm acclimated. Tired? Yeah. Rough? Yeah, but I am rarely hungover unless we are out camping with friends and I stay up late with the guys. I'm never to the point where I can't work or get &quot;the stuff&quot; done. But today I woke up just so sad; it's really getting to me. I've never posted here (anywhere) and I have never really talked to anyone about this issue of being a well spouse or my drinking. I've known for a long time that I was going to have to give up drinking because I can't moderate, but it was working for a while. Well, I guess I can moderate as long as I get numb enough. It's 10-12 light beers every night until I get to my &quot;level,&quot; and then I can crash out the second I hit the pillow. I call it my &quot;tiny suicide.&quot; About 14 years ago, my wife came down with an aggressive neurodegenerative disease after giving birth to our son. She got to where she could no longer safely drive and had fatigue that was crippling. In addition to working as self-employed (IYKYK, that's a tough gig too), I had to take over almost everything, including taking care of my 8-month-old son at nights and sometimes during the day if my wife felt too bad. On top of that, I had a 3-year-old daughter. Well, it wasn't the end of the world as I am a hard worker, and when hero mode kicked in, I kicked ass. About 4.5 years into the stint of doing all the housework, cooking, transportation, etc., I started to crack inside. I LOVE my wife, but I only had so much gas (I am still having a hard time admitting this to myself). My wife still had some mobility, and we still were able to do some things, but I had to &quot;make&quot; those things happen like vacations etc. I was just getting so tired and, to be honest, lonely. Not the kind of lonely that would lead to an affair, just... lonely. Anyway, back to why I am here. I had two bottles of wine that were gifted to me in my closet at work. I would receive them every year from a supplier and would either throw them out or, if they were something on the sweeter side, I would give them to my sister-in-law. During the summer of 2015, my wife mentioned that she would like to try having a drink. She had never drank before. So I brought those gifted wine bottles home. I deep down knew it was probably a bad idea for me because of my personality type. Although when I had quit drinking before, it was because I met the most beautiful woman in the world, and even with that crutch, it was a bit of a challenge to quit. But I was in my early 20s and really didn't feel like I had to get &quot;sober&quot;; I just knew I had to quit a bad habit before my wife and I got married. I mean, this was a choice, not a demand. She would never do that. She was from a religious home and knew it was best for me anyway. So I just quit. One day, I literally just drove past the liquor store once. It was like it was over. Anyway, I brought the bottles home and opened one up. We drank a glass each, and it was f*cking amazing. I felt so chilled and calm and, well, not lonely. Of course, I picked up right where I left off from years prior and ended up basically drinking as often as I could but within certain boundaries because of my responsibilities. On weekends when the grandparents would take the kids to give my wife and I a break, I would get the buzz ON. Problem is, I am a high-functioning drinker. I am the type that gets energetic and just starts crushing everything. Mow the yard, dishes, weed eating, fix the deck, chop wood, whatever; give me a few beers, and we're getting shit done. About 3-4 years ago, I knew it was out of hand. I knew I was drinking to suppress the feelings with what has become of my life with my disabled wife and my loneliness. It worked. For years, it worked. I am still a functioning drinker, but my dopamine receptors are gone. NOTHING makes me happy anymore. I stopped for about a month earlier this year, not drinking though the week but would still drink to excess on weekends. Well, that wasn't really ok, so I just went back to everyday. This past couple of months, I have been soooo tired. I'm not drinking more than usual, still eating good and exercising several days a week, but I am just so f*cking tired. The last couple of weeks, I have been on the road a bit during the day and started listening to sobriety podcasts and listened to 3 virtual AA meetings, and I had a depressing epiphany and I can't shake it. It's bothered me all this past week and weekend. But today, I was already sad about this, right off the bat, listening to Recovery Elevator this morning and one of the guests repeated this thing that I didn't know was a thing that has me beyond sad. I don't get depressed or sad really, but today I am sad to the point of not being able to work... at all. People keep saying they had to &quot;do it for themselves.&quot; I mean, like, what does that even mean? What's more important than my kids? What's more important than making sure my wife's needs are met? How could that not be the reason for me to quit? I realized after hearing so many people say they had to do it for themselves over and over... I, as a person, do not exist anymore and haven't for a long time. EVERYTHING is MS, wife, kids, sports, errands, appointments, work, etc. How am I supposed to quit for &quot;myself&quot; when I do not exist anymore?

    "text": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey all,</p> <p>I’ve basically been a blackout drinker for as long as I can remember. Back in high school and college I’d drink until my brain just… shut off. My body doesn’t react like most people’s — I never throw up, never really feel sick, I just keep going while my brain’s on autopilot. It’s led to a ton of bad nights: kicked out of bars, friends pissed off at me, and even waking up on the sidewalk in the city (once barefoot because my shoes were stolen, once covered in my own pee).</p> <p>When I’m blacked out, I have this tendency to go up to everyone I see — yelling at random people in the street, being loud, getting destructive, just total chaos. It’s like I’m not even there, but my body is doing damage anyway.</p> <p>I used to tell myself it was because of social anxiety — that I’d drink too much to feel comfortable being out. But now I’m in my mid-20s with a solid group of friends who actually care about me, and a girlfriend I love and want to marry someday. We’ve been together on and off since high school, so she’s seen this whole pattern play out for years. Honestly, we’ve been to the edge more times than I can count because of my drinking.</p> <p>The past couple years it’s been the same cycle: • I go too far, get blackout drunk, cause a fight or a near breakup. • Then I “get it together,” stay hyper-aware, stick to light beers, maybe even have some stretches where I handle myself fine. • Then I start giving myself more slack… and eventually I’m right back to blacking out again.</p> <p>More recently I’ve mixed in mushrooms or mushroom edibles with my nights out — and weirdly, it’s been a huge help. It lets me feel social, present, and genuinely happy to be out dancing and talking to people without feeling like I have to drown myself in alcohol. I actually have fun instead of chasing that blackout buzz.</p> <p>I guess I’m just stuck wondering — is there any real hope for someone like me to build healthy habits and stick to moderation? Or is full-on quitting the only way to truly break this loop?</p> <p>I don’t want to keep doing this. I’ve got too much good in my life to keep risking it every time I drink. Just curious if anyone else has been in this spot and what finally clicked for you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/CandidateSad6682\"> /u/CandidateSad6682 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ojm99j/lifelong_blackout_drinker_is_moderation_possible/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ojm99j/lifelong_blackout_drinker_is_moderation_possible/\">[comments]</a></span>",

It was a 4.5 gallon batch that was kegged. When it seemed there was about a gallon left, I put it all into bottles. This one 22oz bottle slipped through the cracks and has been in the back of the fridge with some BBA stout bottles from other breweries. </p> <p>I noticed it a few months ago and didn't have the heart to throw it away. Today I decided it was the day to purge, as I needed some room to store some aged mead that was created for Thanksgiving. Before dumping it down the drain, I thought, what the hell, let's give it a try.</p> <p>I believe it's around 6% and modeled after Left Hand's milk stout, only less lactose/sweetness, more roasted flavor, and a touch more chocolate malt.</p> <p>Pour creates a really nice head that you'd expect from a stout like this.</p> <p>Aroma - still good. Roasty. Some coffee notes. More chocolate notes. No noticeable wet cardboard smell like I thought might show up, or any other &quot;off&quot; smells. So far, so good.</p> <p>Taste - as good as when it was in the keg. Still great carbonation (which was always on the soft side anyway). Medium roast coffee and mocha tastes. Slightly creamy mouthfeel. A bit of sweetness from the lactose in the original brew.</p> <p>Finish - Similar to a cup of coffee with a touch of cream.
