Not the best smell but that's not what counts.\n\nYeah, grape together with lemon. Those are the hoppy flavors in this one. Not that dank part though, that's not here. Body is fine, just a little bit of wateriness in the finish. \n\nActually, there's a hint of a dank musty flavor in the aftertaste. Just a touch. I would have liked bitter there. It's ok.

It’s extremely pleasant with a sweeter than most taste. However, in terms of tasting like a beer - it does a little bit. However, not enough to replicate a 4% lager. I’ve already reviewed the UNLTD IPA (8/10) and it’s got a far better, all round taste IMO. A very refreshing, moreish and light non alcoholic lager that I’d happily drink again, and again. However, I can’t score it any higher because it needs to pack a more powerful punch. \n\nRating 6.5/10\n\n#DryButFly #AlcoholFreeBeer #NonAlcoholicBeer #AlcoholFree #AFBeer #Sober #NoBooze #NoHangover #Beer #Lager #IPA #Stout #PaleAle #Review #AF #UNLTD #UNLTDLager",

    "text": "Clausthaler Lager - A few points to note with this one. Firstly, what an incredibly dark “lager”. Secondly, the syrupy consistency with every sip. I knew after a few seconds this wasn’t one for me. The taste is sharp, it’s pretty sweet and bitter, and leaves an aftertaste I’m not a fan of. I’m here to share my opinions and I love reading others. The non-alcoholic Clausthaler Lager is very popular amongst AF beer drinkers (loads of good reviews online), so definitely give it a go. To the brewers credit - you can tell a lot of work has gone into this one. It’s just not a beverage I’ll be trying again. \n\nRating - 5/10\n\n#DryButFly #AlcoholFreeBeer #NonAlcoholicBeer #AlcoholFree #AFBeer #Sober #NoBooze #NoHangover #Beer #Lager #IPA #Stout #PaleAle #Pilsner #Review #AF #Clausthaler #DryHopped",

We elevate the flavor with an in-house Morita pepper infusion, adding a touch of spice and complexity.\n\nBalanced with Aplós Arise, a citrus forward, herbaceous blend infused with adaptogens and botanical extracts like lemon verbena and agave, it’s designed to uplift and harmonize with your dining experience.\n\nFinished with 100% non-alcoholic Polynesian Kiss bitters, pineapple, and lime, it’s shaken to a vibrant froth that surprises with every sip. Bold, flavorful, and alcohol-free, you may not even miss the spirits.\n\nSip safe, savor deeply. \n\n#ZeroProofCocktail #MindfulDrinking\n\nFIVE SPICE MARTINI\n\nMorita-Infused Aqara Agave De Los Andes Refugio (@aqaraagave)\nAlpos Arise (@aplos.world)\nHouse Chinese Five Spice Simple Syrup\nEl Guapo Polynesian Kiss (@elguapobitters)\nAcidified Pineapple Juice\nFresh Lime Juice",

It didn't have staying power but still looks nice in the photo.\n\nIt smells really fruity with mango and passion fruit. Also some citrus sourness but then again passion fruit has a sour side too.\n\nA sweet base with a decent amount of fruit in the taste as well. Not as much as I smelled but decent. Sweet mango as a base note and passion fruit on top. The citrus is still there which gives it a slight sour in the aftertaste.\n\nThe mango does give it a thickness as does the lactose. I didn't taste the latter which is good but it's on the label. Even then...it could have been a little bit thicker...I get some watery notes. Is that bad? No, just an observation on what could have made the beer better.\n\nIt's tasty enough but then again, it's fruit and fruit is good!\n\n» Smoochie Orange by @brouwerij.lost\n» 0.3% ABV\n» Pastry Sour\n» My Untappd rating: 3.50\n\n#bier #speciaalbier #beer #craftbeer #nonalcoholicbeer #nonalcoholic #alcoholvrij #alcoholfree #alcoholvrijbier #alcoholfreebeer #ikpas #alkoholfrei #alkoholfreibier #beerreview #beersofinstagram #instabeer #beerstagram #beergram #beergeek #beertography #beerlover #beerpic #beerphoto #beertography #brouwerijlost #smoochieorange #sourbeer #pastrysour",

    "text": "Kaiserdom Classic Lager 0.0 - It’s very drinkable but before getting to the flavours, let’s talk about liveliness. This beer held one heck of a head and was extremely bubbly throughout consumption. Perhaps a little too lively, but an encouraging sign nonetheless. As for the colour - mine, as you can see, was pretty hazy and I don’t think this is normal having seen other online reviews. If you have any thoughts, comment below! As for flavour, you can pick out the beer taste immediately but it doesn’t last long. There are floral notes (not my favourite), but overall, despite a strong beer-like aroma, the taste lets this one down a little and it’s not something that’ll make your tastebuds dance. It was fine. Very drinkable and I’d happily pick one every now and then if my local stocked Kaiserdom Classic Lager, but it’s nothing special. \n\nRating - 6.5/10\n\n#DryButFly #AlcoholFreeBeer #NonAlcoholicBeer #AlcoholFree #AFBeer #Sober #NoBooze #NoHangover #Beer #Lager #IPA #Stout #PaleAle #Pilsner #Review #AF #Kaiserdom #ClassicLager",

    "text": "Õllenaut Hele Alkoholibaba 0.5%\n\nThis “non-alcoholic light Estonian beer” by @ollenaut is the first beer from them that I’ve seen in a can. Looking at their socials, they seem to be making a big push to promote this one — which, for a mixed brewery making both alcoholic and alcohol-free beers, I see as a vote of confidence in the AF side.\n\nThis pours a bright mid-gold colour with a touch of haziness and a bright, fluffy white crown of head. The nose is malty and fresh with a pleasant, bready aroma.\n\nI like it when a beer surprises me, and the malt-forward nose on this one had me convinced I knew what was coming next — but I was very wrong. It starts with a sweet, almost sugary mouthfeel and an immediate bitterness that the sweetness prevents from being off-putting. It feels quite sugary in the mouth, but the brewer has chosen to balance that sweetness with a powerful bitterness that runs all the way through. Whenever I feel it might be a bit too much, there’s just enough sweetness to check it.\n\nMy eyes tell me this should be a crisp lager, because that’s how it appears — but instead it’s a full-bodied, sweet yet bitter beer, quite different from a crisp Pilsner. I hope my description conveys the essence of this beer, because I genuinely enjoyed drinking it, even though it delivers that enjoyment in an unusual way. If your alcohol-free beer is going to have a lot of residual sweetness, why try to eliminate it when you can work with it? Here they’ve created something full-bodied, full-flavoured, and defined by its sweetness in a positive way.\n\n81/100\n\n#nabeer #alcoholfree #alcoholfreeworld #afbeer #beer #alcoholfreedrinks",

We elevate the flavor with an in-house Morita pepper infusion, adding a touch of spice and complexity.\n\nBalanced with Aplós Arise, a citrus forward, herbaceous blend infused with adaptogens and botanical extracts like lemon verbena and agave, it’s designed to uplift and harmonize with your dining experience.\n\nFinished with 100% non-alcoholic Polynesian Kiss bitters, pineapple, and lime, it’s shaken to a vibrant froth that surprises with every sip. Bold, flavorful, and alcohol-free, you may not even miss the spirits.\n\nSip safe, savor deeply. \n\n#ZeroProofCocktail #MindfulDrinking\n\nFIVE SPICE MARTINI\n\nMorita-Infused Aqara Agave De Los Andes Refugio (@aqaraagave)\nAlpos Arise (@aplos.world)\nHouse Chinese Five Spice Simple Syrup\nEl Guapo Polynesian Kiss (@elguapobitters)\nAcidified Pineapple Juice\nFresh Lime Juice",

I’m good with what I have, but I appreciate you thinking of me.”\n💬 “This feels really aligned for me right now, and I’m proud of that.”\n💬 “Maybe the better question is… why do we care so much about drinking?” 😉\n\nWhatever you choose to say just say it with love, and know your choice is valid. You don’t need to justify your peace.\n\n✨ This weekend, stay grounded in your why.\nYou’re not missing out - you’re showing up. 🧡\n\n💾 Save this for the next time someone questions your choice\n📤 Share it with someone who’s staying alcohol-free this Thanksgiving\n✨ Follow @sober.strong.marianne for more tools & inspiration for your sober journey\n\n#soberoctober #sobercurious #soberthanksgiving #soberliving #soberjourney #selflovejourney #healingjourney #alcoholfree #mindbodyconnection #sobercommunity",

    "text": "On March 20, I made one small decision that I had no idea would improve my life so drastically: It was a busy night of taking my son to CrossFit and judo and I had promised both kids we’d go to Target afterward, so we didn’t head home until around 9pm and I just didn’t stop to grab wine like I’d intended. I got home, tired, and decided I didn’t need it. Mind you, I’d had a glass of wine a night (and honestly often 2, sometimes more on weekends) for a long time (except while pregnant obviously). A glass after work to unwind and then maybe another with dinner. Can’t remember the last time I got drunk, I just drank often. So one night I didn’t. And then decided the next day to see how long I could just…not drink. I drank nothing for 4 months, and then had a glass of wine with a friend from out of town. On vacation I had a beer at the beach and a glass of wine while grilling. Braced to see if I’d revert back to near daily drinking but I didn’t. I trust myself to remain almost 100% sober and it’s been everything I didn’t know I needed. If you’ve been considering it: do it! My skin is better because I’m not dehydrated all the time, my weight has consistently dropped month after month as I’ve also had more energy to double my days at the gym from 3 days a week to 6. I feel more regulated and focused. I’m less hungry and also have more mental clarity to choose better foods and eat in a calorie deficit. I feel like I’ve recommitted to myself - and while I wish I’d done so sooner, I’m proud of where I’m at. I realize my posts and stories can be annoying, but I’m proud of myself for being able to do this through one small decision and then daily discipline thereafter. Special thanks to my fiancé @jacktcampbell83 for giving me time every day to focus on my self care. I love you forever ❤️ #gymselfie #shamelessselfie #naturalweightloss #alcoholfree",

It wasn't just about health or family, it was the catalyst for my financial success and personal growth. \n\nRemoving this one obstacle unlocked:\n⚡️ INSTANT ENERGY BOOST: Gaining 2+ productive hours daily for skill-building, networking, and launching businesses. \n🧠 DECISION-MAKING CLARITY: Leading to smarter financial choices and avoiding costly mistakes.\n🤝 NETWORK UPGRADES: Connecting with driven, health-conscious individuals and opening doors to lucrative opportunities.\n🎯 FOCUS & IDENTITY SHIFT: Transforming from a consumer to a creator, prioritizing long-term value over short-term pleasure.\n\nSuccess isn't always about adding more; sometimes, it's about subtraction. Saying NO to alcohol meant saying YES to immense wealth and fulfillment. Prioritizing family and breaking cycles can be the most profitable move.\n\n#soberliving #financialfreedom #personalgrowth #wealthcreation #mindset #successmindset #discipline #narcoticsanonymous #alcoholfree #entrepreneurship #removedistractions #productivity",

You’ll never see the debt, depression, or addiction people hide behind on social media!\n\nI’ve had to start over more times than I can count. (This was my FINAL time) Although I always kept a roof over our heads, I  was mentally checked out for a lot of years. I missed moments with my son while wondering why I wasn’t enough, why I wasn't so lucky, and numbing myself instead of healing. I couldn't process my grief and my discouragements. It came out as drunken rage. \n\nPeople thought I had it together — but behind closed doors, I was breaking.\n\nNow, that I'm open about my sobriety and sharing my story, I feel so free! Because for the first time in a long time, I’m not just surviving — I’m living 😍\n\nIf you’re struggling right now — please don’t give up. Your story isn’t over, it’s just beginning. Healing takes time, and sometimes the restart is where the real magic happens. ❤️\n\nAnd If it's Day 1 or Day 100, keep going! \n\nDay 509❤️🥳 #sobrietyjourney #alcoholfree #alcoholismawareness",

Alcohol was never a huge problem, but it kept me from growing and made the issues linger.\n\nEarly in my career, I decided that bottling up emotions made life in the Marines easier. It got me through deployments and bad moments — but over time, mixed with my mental health struggles and the ups and downs of medication, I lost sight of myself and what mattered most.\n\nThe whole reason I was staying in the Marines for so long was on the brink of falling away, and I almost didn't realize it.\nBut with Kim and therapy, I was  pulled back from that self-exile and reminded what matters most to me.\n\nI’m still struggling, and this year’s been a train wreck — but today, I’m proud of how far I’ve come.\nAnd I wouldn’t be here without the love of my life, who gave me the motivation to never give up, even when things were rough between us. ❤️\n.\n.\n.\n#sober #alcoholfree #therepy #relationship #gymday #husbandandwife",

Insecurity. \n\nAll these things drove me to drink. \n\nAt first it started as a way to “calm the anxiety” in large social gatherings. Then in morphed into “breaking down my walls of insecurity” in those same settings… causing me to consume multiple drinks when I was out.\n\nAt home… it became a crutch. “An escape”.\n\nWhat I didn’t know was that using alcohol for all these situations…where I thought it was helping…was actually making all of those battles bigger and harder to overcome. \n\nI have learned SO much, about SO much, on this alcohol free journey. But the number one thing I’ve learned is that all those “magic” things they use to market alcohol (stress release, reducing anxiety, etc…) those things all get worse the more you drink. They all get harder and harder to overcome, even WITH alcohol. \n\nIf any of this resonates with you, and you are still using alcohol as your outlet….\n\n🗣️ FIND. ANOTHER. OUTLET. 👏🏼 👏🏼 👏🏼 \n\nTake it from me. The sooner you stop, the faster you’ll heal. And the fast you heal, the better you will FEEL. \n\nMy two major outlets that I use are Jesus and running/activity. \n\n(Ps.. I’m not reducing Jesus and “using” him only as an outlet. He’s a part of my everyday life; just wanted to clarify!) \n\nWhen I am the most stressed, my husband says “go for a run and put your worship music on.” \n\nMY GOODNESS does it make a difference! And bonus: NO HANGOVER! 😆 \n\nDitch the booze. Find a new outlet. And start LIVING! \n\nIf you’re struggling with alcohol use, let’s chat! Message me or click the link in my bio and fill out the application. I’d love to walk alongside you on your journey to freedom!",

Here’s how:\n\n🌙 Better Sleep: Alcohol disrupts REM cycles. Within weeks, you’ll sleep deeper and wake up more refreshed.\n🧠 Gut Regeneration: The gut lining starts to heal, improving digestion and nutrient absorption.\n💪 Faster Muscle Growth: Alcohol inhibits protein synthesis — removing it boosts recovery and strength gains.\n🛡️ Stronger Immunity: Immune cells rebound, reducing inflammation and increasing resilience.\n🌸 Clearer Skin: Hydration improves, inflammation decreases, and your complexion brightens naturally.\n💗 Liver Recovery: Enzyme levels normalize, detox pathways strengthen, and overall energy rises.\n\n📚 According to a study in Alcohol Research: Current Reviews (NIH, 2021), abstaining from alcohol improves liver function, reduces cortisol, and restores hormonal balance — leading to better mental and physical performance.\n\n✨ Small lifestyle changes lead to massive health shifts. Challenge yourself — 4 weeks can change your life.\n\n🔖 Follow @dailynaturopath for more evidence-based detox tips, natural health facts, and daily motivation to optimize your wellness.\n\n#dailynaturopath #alcoholfree #detoxnaturally #holistichealing #naturopathicmedicine #wellnessjourney #mindbodybalance #liverdetox #mentalclarity #healthylifestyle #recoveryjourney #naturalhealing",

It's both part of my #alcoholfree series and #surrealistesaturday and what I've got is a pale brew...a non-alcoholic IPA.\n\nThere's a bit of a grainy undertone in the smell but there's a dank and grape combo on top. Not the best smell but that's not what counts.\n\nYeah, grape together with lemon. Those are the hoppy flavors in this one. Not that dank part though, that's not here. Body is fine, just a little bit of wateriness in the finish. \n\nActually, there's a hint of a dank musty flavor in the aftertaste. Just a touch. I would have liked bitter there. It's ok.

What's even more impressive is the price. It comes in a pack of 6 for under £4 (£3.29 I believe). It doesn't fall into the AF pitfalls that some do, which you may expect given the price. \nIt's not fancy, but it's not trying to be. Just a good lager for a good price.

    "text": "UNLTD Lager 0.5% - It’s usually a good sign when the wife takes a sip and says it’s “really nice!” However she’s not a big beer drinker and prefers the ‘safer’ options, and that is exactly what UNLTD Lager is. It’s extremely pleasant with a sweeter than most taste. However, in terms of tasting like a beer - it does a little bit. However, not enough to replicate a 4% lager. I’ve already reviewed the UNLTD IPA (8/10) and it’s got a far better, all round taste IMO. A very refreshing, moreish and light non alcoholic lager that I’d happily drink again, and again. However, I can’t score it any higher because it needs to pack a more powerful punch. \n\nRating 6.5/10\n\n#DryButFly #AlcoholFreeBeer #NonAlcoholicBeer #AlcoholFree #AFBeer #Sober #NoBooze #NoHangover #Beer #Lager #IPA #Stout #PaleAle #Review #AF #UNLTD #UNLTDLager",

I knew after a few seconds this wasn’t one for me. The taste is sharp, it’s pretty sweet and bitter, and leaves an aftertaste I’m not a fan of. I’m here to share my opinions and I love reading others. The non-alcoholic Clausthaler Lager is very popular amongst AF beer drinkers (loads of good reviews online), so definitely give it a go. To the brewers credit - you can tell a lot of work has gone into this one. It’s just not a beverage I’ll be trying again. \n\nRating - 5/10\n\n#DryButFly #AlcoholFreeBeer #NonAlcoholicBeer #AlcoholFree #AFBeer #Sober #NoBooze #NoHangover #Beer #Lager #IPA #Stout #PaleAle #Pilsner #Review #AF #Clausthaler #DryHopped",

It didn't have staying power but still looks nice in the photo.\n\nIt smells really fruity with mango and passion fruit. Also some citrus sourness but then again passion fruit has a sour side too.\n\nA sweet base with a decent amount of fruit in the taste as well. Not as much as I smelled but decent. Sweet mango as a base note and passion fruit on top. The citrus is still there which gives it a slight sour in the aftertaste.\n\nThe mango does give it a thickness as does the lactose. I didn't taste the latter which is good but it's on the label. Even then...it could have been a little bit thicker...I get some watery notes. Is that bad? No, just an observation on what could have made the beer better.\n\nIt's tasty enough but then again, it's fruit and fruit is good!\n\n» Smoochie Orange by @brouwerij.lost\n» 0.3% ABV\n» Pastry Sour\n» My Untappd rating: 3.50\n\n#bier #speciaalbier #beer #craftbeer #nonalcoholicbeer #nonalcoholic #alcoholvrij #alcoholfree #alcoholvrijbier #alcoholfreebeer #ikpas #alkoholfrei #alkoholfreibier #beerreview #beersofinstagram #instabeer #beerstagram #beergram #beergeek #beertography #beerlover #beerpic #beerphoto #beertography #brouwerijlost #smoochieorange #sourbeer #pastrysour",

    "text": "Kaiserdom Classic Lager 0.0 - It’s very drinkable but before getting to the flavours, let’s talk about liveliness. This beer held one heck of a head and was extremely bubbly throughout consumption. Perhaps a little too lively, but an encouraging sign nonetheless. As for the colour - mine, as you can see, was pretty hazy and I don’t think this is normal having seen other online reviews. If you have any thoughts, comment below! As for flavour, you can pick out the beer taste immediately but it doesn’t last long. There are floral notes (not my favourite), but overall, despite a strong beer-like aroma, the taste lets this one down a little and it’s not something that’ll make your tastebuds dance. It was fine. Very drinkable and I’d happily pick one every now and then if my local stocked Kaiserdom Classic Lager, but it’s nothing special. \n\nRating - 6.5/10\n\n#DryButFly #AlcoholFreeBeer #NonAlcoholicBeer #AlcoholFree #AFBeer #Sober #NoBooze #NoHangover #Beer #Lager #IPA #Stout #PaleAle #Pilsner #Review #AF #Kaiserdom #ClassicLager",

    "text": "Left Handed Giant Run Free - A seriously, seriously good alcohol free IPA! Brewed by Left Handed Giant (Bristol) and served at the wonderful @marvs_ampthill, Run Free is a 0.5% ABV IPA bursting with flavour. It’s no secret that beers taste better on tap, and this not only looked exceptional, but the citrusy flavours make this one of the very best. Again, I asked my boozing buddy for his take on this AF beverage and he agreed - very good indeed! It’s quite heavy so I couldn’t class this as a “session” beer (unlike some of the AF lagers I’ve had), but I really hope it’s on tap next time I visit. Having checked out the Left Handed Giant website, I’d happily pay the pretty hefty £3.90 for some cans. Even if you’re not seeking alcohol free beers, if you come across Run Free - give it a go, as you won’t be disappointed. \n\nRating - 9.5/10\n\n#DryButFly #AlcoholFreeBeer #NonAlcoholicBeer #AlcoholFree #AFBeer #Sober #NoBooze #NoHangover #Beer #Lager #IPA #Stout #PaleAle #Review #AF #LeftHandedGiant #RunFree",

I’m not gonna lie it was really for cookies because have you ever had the cookies at Jimmy’s? OMG, the best cookies ever. EVER. Period. Full stop. There is no way you will change my mind. Anywhooo..I got some cookies to enjoy later. This is about the pizza. Pepperoni, Black Garlic, Black Garlic Molasses, Goat Cheese with their traditional sauce and mozzarella cheese. This pizza hit on every level of flavor. Sweet, Salty, Spice from the roni, Umami from the black garlic..just so incredibly delicious. I’ve been 97% california sober (I make cocktails..I have no choice..) for the last year..so I love that we now have so many alternatives. Today I had the Berry Lemonade Hop Water by @maplewoodbrew I’m gonna give this an 8/10 because the Hops weren’t hopping..but besides that it was lightly flavored, lightly carbonated and seriously refreshing. I was just looking for the hops. Overall lunch was an overall 9/10 and those cookies..They’ll be a 175/10. #jimmyspizza #jimmyspizzacafe #chicagoeats #lincolnsquarechicago #cervesoria #daysoff #maplewood #hopwater",

The bourbon barrel flavor completely dominates the malt liquor flavor and its just not pleasant to drink. You should still give it a try if youre curious.

A hot Friday in June about 105 degrees on the blacktop at the airport that day, covered in sweat and jet fuel. (I work line tech) Despite the blazing heat the breeze was cool so shit felt nice. Got off work at 4:30 and hopped in my 98 shitbox camry that runs like a dream. Put on some summer music. Went for the classic 70’s that day and man was I stoked to get home. I marinated some Jerk chicken the night previous and bought some charcoal for the grill. Got home and was greeted by my lovely wife and my two dumbass dogs along with our farm cats. The afternoon onshore breeze was cooling off the heat and I got the charcoal going and grill smoking. That smell hits deep in the good memory department. I kept the 70’s going 1on my portable speaker and before I threw the chicken on the grill I remembered I had some Pacificos in the fridge which I kept ice cold. Asked the wife to grab me one and despite what your opinion is on the best beer, that Pacifico hit like no other. Shit was crisp, flavorful, and refreshing. What followed was a delicious dinner with my wife and dogs sitting outside watching the sunset paired with a couple more Pacificos sporting a nice buzz. </p> <p>Idk that memory hits good and after typing this out I realized the goal wasn’t the beer. It was the food, the company, the music, the smell of that charcoal going. Yet one beer made everything click into place. Created a small yet meaningful memory in my life that I frequently look back on whenever I’m stressed and I sometimes try to replicate that night but find it hard to do so, maybe that’s why it was special. </p> <p>Anyways Pacifico for the win I guess :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/kerchenowen71\"> /u/kerchenowen71 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1o1elvp/good_moment_good_beer/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1o1elvp/good_moment_good_beer/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Yesterday was the annual “Chase Race” for our local Countryside Alliance which is an organization of landowners, farmers, hunters and equestrians who seek to preserve land for traditional fox hunting and cross country (riding across natural terrain, jumping fences, streams, stone walls, etc…) riding and racing. Long day, up early, getting horses prepped, loaded and transported, two of my daughters rode, setting up the tailgate area (tons of food and booze-mostly bourbon), and then breaking it all down and going home and putting it all away at the end of the day. </p> <p>I’ve been to plenty of these as a spectator with a DD which was a good time in my 20s and early 30s, but in my 40s, as much as I still love beer and bourbon, even I could be completely carefree it’s not worth it the next day. After getting a ton of good suggestions here I loaded up on a bunch of different fall NA beers (Athletic, Partake and Sam Adams) and brought an assortment to the tailgate. It doesn’t hit EXACTLY the same but it scratches the itch for me at least. In any event, enjoyed cold beer all day, tons of good food, sips of bourbon here and there, and took a load of horses and people home sober as a judge at the end. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Gullible_Rich_7156\"> /u/Gullible_Rich_7156 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1nyo973/na_beer_cheat_code_for_enjoying_cold_carbonated/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1nyo973/na_beer_cheat_code_for_enjoying_cold_carbonated/\">[comments]</a></span>",

For one, if you aren't drinking beer you are either not in the beer garden, or you are going out of the beer garden to get soda, lemonade, etc. and I think people would be willing to pay &quot;alcohol&quot; prices for premium mocktails and NA drinks and stay within the 21+ areas.</p> <p>C.

Imagine my joy when I saw this one in my local B&amp;M for a tenner for the gift set...I had to have it. Is it good though? Let's find out.</p> <p>Invincible pours a nice deep gold colour, slightly hazy, with a loose white head. The aroma is sweet citrus and tropical, with plenty of it to boot. The body is light to medium with high levels of vibrant carbonation. The flavour is wonderful, bitter, hoppy, with a citrus twist and a subtle pineapple suggestion to finish it off. It's well balanced with the hops and bitterness, something that makes me very happy. On the back end is where the bitterness really shines, it's slightly resinous and piney, and it's here where that lays roots on your tongue, lasting for a good time.</p> <p>So yes, this is a corker of a beer, with bags of flavour and an aggressive carbonation, much like the riffage in your typical JP track. The only thing I'd change is the body, and that would be to make it as heavy as Priest's music, but that's a tough ask for any alcohol free beer. 4.6/5 from me, with a buy again and value for money bonus.

    "title": "Spiritless Kentucky 74 Spiced Non-Alcoholic Bourbon - Review",
    "text": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I’ve tried many non-alcoholic whiskey alternatives, but most lack the layered flavors I look for in a bourbon. While this isn’t an apples-to-apples comparison with real bourbons, Kentucky 74 Spiced comes surprisingly close. Spiritless labels it as a cinnamon whiskey, but it’s not the candy-cinnamon-forward style you get in Fireball or similar products. Instead, it aligns more with bourbons that feature woodsy cinnamon notes layered into a balanced profile.</p> <p>Tasting Notes:</p> <ul> <li>Charred Oak - Oak and Smoke</li> <li>Vanilla - rounded sweetness</li> <li>Caramel</li> <li>Warm Baking Spices <ul> <li>Woodsy Cinnamon Bite - noticeable but not overpowering</li> <li>Clove - adds depth and warmth</li> <li>Maybe some Nutmeg and Allspice, but subtle</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p>Overall, Kentucky 74 Spiced is well-balanced and harmonious, with its spice and sweetness seamlessly layered over a foundation of oak and vanilla. A top choice among non-alcoholic whiskeys for those seeking a bourbon-like experience.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BigBig5\"> /u/BigBig5 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nonalcoholic/comments/1nugqui/spiritless_kentucky_74_spiced_nonalcoholic/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nonalcoholic/comments/1nugqui/spiritless_kentucky_74_spiced_nonalcoholic/\">[comments]</a></span>",

So I’ve tried glen dochus. ( ughh ) and spiritless 74, which is pretty good- but no burn. I know it’s the alcohol that does it, but HP has done pretty well IMO. It’s just impossible to find its so niche ( I live in Utah) and when I do ( like Upside Down) they are always sold out. Would a cinnamon Spiritless be any good’? Ritual? What can I add to make it burn more? Jalapeños? Any spicy syrups? Any ideas?

Back in the spring, <a href=\"https://www.somegoodcleanfun.com/blog/non-alcoholic-drinks-that-give-you-a-buzz\">I pulled together a list of the best non-alcoholic drinks that give you a buzz without the alcohol</a>. I wanted to update it, and thought I would crowd source in case I'm missing anything - I've ranked Kava Haven as the best, followed by Sentia, Dromme and bonbuz. I did include a few cbd-mocktails because it's technically still a buzz without alcohol. Any suggestions on new stuff out there that actually makes you feel something? (note: when I say buzz, I mean body buzz and not head buzz). Thanks everyone!<br /> (P.S.

The first ten years I was a “social” drinker and didn’t “think I had a problem.” The last ten years were a steady decline in an unhealthy direction as I went through my thirties. This year I turned 38 &amp; decided enough was enough. I’ve posted about it on here lots &amp; this community is what helped me get this far, thank you. </p> <p>There was a big event at work tonight, lots of alcohol. A client who likes spending money on expensive wine sent over a glass. For a second I thought “I’ve made it thirty days, maybe today is the day I have a glass again?” </p> <p>As soon as it touched my lips all I tasted was … poison. No magical elixir unlocking secret pleasures of a higher realm. Just … poison. Which is exactly what alcohol is. I thought, why would I want to sabotage all that work and go back down the path I worked so hard to get away from? It was oddly affirming that my sober self said to that little treacherous voice in my head, “No, this is not you anymore.” </p> <p>To anyone considering quitting, do whatever it takes. It will be worth it. This is probably the most difficult, frustrating thing I have ever done. But it feels like I am starting to redefine myself. Recovery is saying no to alcohol and saying yes to yourself again. Sobriety is my strength &amp; it’s my first priority. </p> <p>To everyone struggling out there reading this, you are not alone.

    "text": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey all! I’m over 4 months free from booze, nicotine and cannabis, and man has it been a wild ride. I read the Allen Cerr books and something finally just clicked about addictions for me. I was also fresh from a suicide attempt and really just sick of my bullshit. 31 years old and told myself I’d stop smoking by 30. Had almost 90 days sober last year from booze- but fell back in. This time was different- I was ready. So I decided June 1st would give me half my year to do it all better. And I’m doing it! I’ve been experimenting with intermittent fasting (working on getting back on track with it), started some mild strength training, talking long walks, and start jogging again. I was able to go camping three times this year- had extra money for some better gear too! Also reading and meditating, really trying to fix all the damage I’ve done to this brain and body. Some days are amazing and I feel truly blessed to be here, others I still feel like hiding in my bed, but honestly, the bad days fade quicker now. I realize not that sobriety fixes everything- but that sobriety gives me the space to fix it myself. As a way to keep myself motivated with the jogging I signed up for a 5k a few months back- and today- I freaking did it! Haven’t ran one in like 8 years 😅 As a very antisocial person it was strange to be surrounded with people, but honestly it felt nice to see others doing their best. </p> <p>I hope this inspires someone! You all are very inspiring to me!</p> <p>Here's to not wanting to die anymore and actually trying to live again!!! ❤️‍🩹</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Scared-Issue3597\"> /u/Scared-Issue3597 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1o46cqi/ran_a_5k_today/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1o46cqi/ran_a_5k_today/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I’m working full-time, taking five grad school classes, and just trying to keep up with life. I thought things would feel better by now, but instead I feel flat, unmotivated, and like I can’t enjoy anything. I was broken up with 4 months ago and he was my major support person, and I just feel so abandoned.</p> <p>My skin picking (dermatillomania) is worse than ever, I’m not sleeping well, and I keep craving something, nicotine, anything, to make me feel better. I even bought a vape recently, used it for a few days, got nic sick, threw it away, and now I’m still craving it. My hobbies don’t feel interesting, and I don’t care to socialize.</p> <p>Sometimes I catch myself thinking I wish I could just drink again and escape this. I don’t want to go back, but I miss the feeling of relief it used to give me. Now that I’m sober, everything feels so real and heavy. I miss my ex, I feel behind at work, I’m drowning in schoolwork, and I’m just exhausted.</p> <p>Has anyone else gone through this, where you’re sober but miserable and just craving something?

I just woke up in the middle of the night and realized I downed two bottles. And its not even midnight. But I started before dinner. Struggled my way through. Bought more after dinner. I barely remember it. </p> <p>How the hell did I get here. Why wont I just stop. Something is seriously wrong with me. The day I relapsed, I was barely able to drink a bottle. And every day since has been an increase. </p> <p>I have seriously lost the plot and I need to turn this car around on myself. But I dont know how. I dont know how to deal with being in the know, being aware, and doing my best, only to fail so massively on myself. Why. Im feeling so hopeless right now.Like Im just doomed to fail.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Lady-227\"> /u/Lady-227 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1o46t4d/its_getting_way_worse/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1o46t4d/its_getting_way_worse/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Got so drunk and depressed that I called my parents and told them some really dark shit, about me thinking about ending it all.

    "text": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Daily heavy drinker here, like half to a full fifth a day, easy. I’ve been on and off the wagon for days, weeks, months at a time for about six years. My last drink was around 2 or 3am Sunday after one of the worst benders I’ve had in a while. I stopped because I needed at least a day to see how bad the withdrawals would get before flying out to see my mom, who’s going through cancer treatment.</p> <p>Monday was hell. I was shaking, sweating, nauseous, heart racing. I didn’t sleep because I was afraid the DTs would hit me if I closed my eyes. I white-knuckled it through those first few days, mostly out of fear and guilt. I didn’t want my family to see me like that again. They’ve already seen it all l: hospital visits, detox, rehab, psych ward, sober living. Six months clean, then right back to the same shit.</p> <p>I also called out of work for three days during that last bender. My boss told me I’m on my last chance. Can’t even blame him, I’ve done this to myself over and over pretty much every month this year. </p> <p>Now I’m on day six. Still foggy, still not sleeping much, but my appetite’s back. I’ve eaten three meals a day for the first time in months. It’s such a small thing but it feels huge.</p> <p>Here’s what’s got me twisted up: I left half a handle and a case of seltzers at home when I flew out. I fly back tomorrow night. I keep thinking about walking through that door and picking up right where I left off. And I don’t want to. Not this time. After seeing my mom in her condition, I just want to stop. I want to be present. I want to have something left in me to give.</p> <p>I know I can’t keep doing this alone. Any advice or encouragement from people who’ve been through this would mean a lot right now.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/luckyjackass\"> /u/luckyjackass </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1o46i5w/day_6_scared_to_go_home/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1o46i5w/day_6_scared_to_go_home/\">[comments]</a></span>",

However it coincidentally is lining up with a really difficult time in my life. I unexpectedly lost housing and have to live with my friend for the next two months (sleeping in her bed w her no room to myself etc) which also means sending my dog who is my world to live with my mom for that time. My boyfriend who has been my rock, cheerleader, absolute love of my life for the past year or so is moving to Japan in three days and we made the mature choice to not continue with a relationship. This in combination with financial struggles has been really weighing on me without a drink. There’s nothing to numb me out and a lot of daily support and comfort is going to be leaving me this month. I’m starting to feel the sinking horrible sadness I’ve been able to avoid or ignore with drinking. It’s hard to feel that type of thing drunk or violently hungover. I’m struggling to sit with these feelings. I’m trying to hit meetings when I can and read the big book. It’s just a hard time when this is the saddest my life has felt in awhile and I just have to raw dog it in order for things to get better. Some things feel brighter, but with that comes a general depth and seriousness of life I was able to completely ignore. I just wish I didn’t have to feel these things but I guess that’s how I became a problem drinker in the first place. I can already feel myself replacing drinking with my bad thrifting habit I had kicked lol. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/nicorettedaydreams\"> /u/nicorettedaydreams </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1o4429y/confronted_w_the_sadness_vent/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1o4429y/confronted_w_the_sadness_vent/\">[comments]</a></span>",
