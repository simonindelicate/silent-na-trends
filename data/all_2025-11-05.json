There are an incredible amount of bubbles rapid firing like a geyser, keeping the head intact. \n3/3 \n\nAroma: floral, citrus, grapefruit, earthy/grass/peppery upfront that meets a caramel, bready and toffee backend. \n10.25/12\n\nFlavor: Pungent bitterness, floral, orange pith, grapefruit, copper pennies, grass, earthy, spicy/peppery, dank, piney that meets a beautifully balanced malt backbone of caramel, toffee and bread. There is a lingering bitterness throughout. Wow! \n17.75/20\n\nMouthfeel: It is creamy and approaching medium body. It is carbonic enough to notice the light sting but not over the top or distracting. It leaves the mouth on the dry side, yet is refreshing. \n4.75/5\n\nOverall: Balls to the wall! One of the most bitter Athletic Brews I have had. Their Fresh Hop series are always a treat! They push the alpha acids to the max with their Wet Hop IPA.

    "text": "Vandestreek Playground - Here we have a non alcoholic IPA (ABV 0.5%) brewed by Vandestreek, based in the Netherlands. This brewery is new to me but first impressions were good because the bottle looks awesome! I love a good IPA but the bottle doesn’t give much away about the liquid inside. That said, before tasting, the pour was fun. Great head and an all-round beautiful, deep-looking IPA that I was excited to taste. The first thing that I noticed was the sharpness upon first sip, which remains with the drink throughout. It doesn’t taste non-alcoholic - that’s a fact. Have a try yourself and I’m confident you’ll agree. Like a lot of IPAs, it’s full of citrusy flavours, but for me, the sharpness was always the first thing I noticed every sip, slightly ruining the flavours. It’s also a tad syrupy, something I’m not a fan of. It’s a good AF IPA, and I’d happily drink again. But compared to Mash Gang Chug, it’s second best in my opinion. A good beer, but not the best beer. \n\nRating - 7/10\n\n#DryButFly #AlcoholFreeBeer #NonAlcoholicBeer #AlcoholFree #AFBeer #Sober #NoBooze #NoHangover #Beer #Lager #IPA #Stout #PaleAle #Pilsner #Review #AF #HazyPaleAle #Vandestreek #Playground",

    "text": "Mash Gang Lesser Evil - Bit of a problem here. I’m not a big stout fan (but obviously love Guinness Zero) and I really can’t stand cherries. This is a stout (ABV 0.5%) with chocolate and cherries. I’m not for a second saying it’s a bad beverage. However, as this is a personal review platform, I’m going to have to rate it at the bare minimum because unfortunately, I couldn’t finish it. However, please make sure you leave your own rating by commenting below. Mash Gang make CRACKING beverages and if you’re looking for an alcohol free stout and enjoy cherries - absolutely get yourself a can or two of Lesser Evil. However, it’s not for me, and I won’t be buying again! One thing I should add - I am absolutely not a beer expert and far from a stout drinker, but I would never have guessed this was ABV 0.5%. It tastes like a stout should (I think), but just wasn’t one I could stomach. I can highly recommend the following brews from Mash Gang (ideal if you’re like me, and aren’t a big fan of stouts, and especially cherries) - Cult (pale ale), Chug (IPA) and Glug (lager).\n\nRating - 1/10\n\n#DryButFly #AlcoholFreeBeer #NonAlcoholicBeer #AlcoholFree #AFBeer #Sober #NoBooze #NoHangover #Beer #Lager #IPA #Stout #PaleAle #Pilsner #Review #AF #HazyPaleAle #MashGang #LesserEvil",

A golden, straw body, some haze but not enough to obscure the bubbles. \n2.5/3 \n\nAroma: peach, grapefruit, pine upfront with some earthy/grass and hints of dankness in the background. \n10/12\n\nFlavor: Big time pine and citrus — like orange pith, grapefruit, some herbal notes with a nice bitter, yet refreshing finish. \n15.25/20\n\nMouthfeel: creamy, medium body, carbonation is light to approaching medium level making the hops pop more abundantly. It leaves the mouth slightly dry, yet refreshed. \n4.25/5\n\nOverall: I have always enjoyed, Athletic Brewing Beers, Closer By The Mile and Paceline Pedal. They all have very similar, clean hoppy bite with pine, citrus and grapefruit being the main star. Pedal To Promise is no different.

    "text": "Mash Gang Glug - There is no shortage of alcohol free lagers in the market. However, having reviewed plenty, there is a real shortage of flavourful alcohol free lagers out there. Having tried a few Mash Gang beers now, including Cult (pale ale) and Chug (IPA), I was extremely confident that Glug (lager) would be decent, and I was right. Firstly, it smells lush! And when you pour it, the golden liquid forms a small, but authentic looking head (which disappeared before I got my photo, slightly disappointing). Taste wise - there is a lot going on. The brewers state Glug is “crisp and complex” and I’d have to agree - especially with “crisp”. As for complexity, I don’t have the sophisticated pallet I wish I had, but this beer has a hint of lime and gooseberries, and while I may not have been able to pinpoint these additions, they make for a delicious beverage! It’s seriously tasty, and with so many “mainstream” AF lagers tasting like fizzy water, this instantly stands in a class of its own. It tastes alcoholic and I am confident if you gave this to 100 lager drinkers, not many would flag it is only ABV 0.5%. Another triumph from the Mash Gang team. Skip my reviews for the rest of my beers (actually, please don’t) - if you want authentic tasting AF beers with modern twists and genuine flavour, check out @mash__gang (who don’t sponsor me in any way and there is no connection between us - I should point out in case you think I’m biased, which I’m not). I’ve got plenty of Glug in the fridge (for now). Excellent! \n\nRating 9/10\n\n#DryButFly #AlcoholFreeBeer #NonAlcoholicBeer #AlcoholFree #AFBeer #Sober #NoBooze #NoHangover #Beer #Lager #IPA #Stout #PaleAle #Pilsner #Review #AF #MashGang #Glug",

    "text": "Tartarus Sprite – 0.5%\n\n@tartarusbeers is a Leeds-based microbrewery famous for producing full-flavoured beers with a mythical twist. You might remember their excellent Moon Rabbit AF porter or their groundbreaking IPA Pixie, which was the first AF beer to make me wonder whether it might be time to make beers with less flavour.\n\nThis pours a straw-coloured, hazy, dank-looking beer with a foamy, bubbly head that forms gamely enough before giving up – I imagine the heavy hop load, which I detect on the nose, is too much for it to withstand. The hoppy aroma is strong, zesty citrus with a dry grapefruit edge.\n\nBreaking the fourth wall for a moment: as I first tasted this, I spent a good 30 seconds making motorbike-revving noises – not something I often do while drinking beer. That reaction came from the sweet but strong initial blast of citrusy hops powering through. It felt like being carried off your feet by a strong but not dangerous wave – maybe in a waterpark rather than the open sea. There’s plenty of sweetness, but it’s needed to keep hop burn at bay. This teeters delicately on the right side of being too forceful – and crucially, it stays there. That’s what makes this such a wild, joyful ride.\n\nFor a beer with so much flavour, it’s not especially complex in terms of layers of hop or cereal notes. The complexity lies in how that rush of bitter hop and sugar carries you along and leaves you smiling by the finish. Like a great waterpark ride, you just want to run back up the steps and do it all again.\n\nI’ve described beers as fun and happy before, but few have put as much of a smile on my face as this one. Yes, it’s not subtle, and some of the more delicate aspects of beer are missing – but it’s so exhilarating that I’m happily dusting off a gold award for it.\n\n92/100\n\n#nabeer #alcoholfree #alcoholfreeworld #afbeer #beer #alcoholfreedrinks #afworldgold",

    "text": "Thrive Peak – 0.3%\n\n@thrivebeer is a Belgian specialist AF brand already known for its electrolyte-rich recovery beer and magnesium-enhanced beer. Now they’ve released one with 10 g of protein per can, developed alongside experts from @kuleuven and brewed by the good folks at De Proef. As someone who consumes a lot of protein drinks post-gym (I aim for 180 g per day), the idea of getting a boost from an AF beer definitely appeals.\n\nIt feels like a beer with added protein as I pour it – there’s extra viscosity to the pale gold liquid. The head forms a satisfying white cushion before fading back, and the nose is light, citrusy, and carries that trademark De Proef character, presumably from the NEER yeast strain.\n\nIt opens with a light, slightly floral, slightly citrus note that does something unusual. Rather than dissipating as the beer develops, that same lemony-floral note builds and intensifies, perhaps because the protein-rich liquid absorbs the beer’s flavours differently. The result is reminiscent of many other De Proef beers – but on steroids (if you’ll forgive the fitness analogy). If you’ve tried Beavertown’s Laser Crush AF, imagine tripling the flavour intensity and you’ll get close to how this tastes.\n\nI quite like the amplified floral-citrus blend going on here, but it’s an unusually strong presentation of those flavours, and that’s going to be an immediate deal-breaker for some.\n\nI don’t judge the efficacy of nootropics or adaptogens in beers when I review them, so I’m scoring this purely on taste – without bonus points for the 10 g of protein. Still, it’s a beer I’ll have again and again, because I love the idea of getting some protein while I enjoy an AF beer.\n\n73/100\n\n#nabeer #alcoholfree #alcoholfreeworld #afbeer #beer #alcoholfreedrinks",

    "text": "A Le Coq 0.0 Alkoholivaba Õlu – 0.0%\n\nTartu, Estonia’s @elusonmaitset has been appearing here quite often recently, with some fruity beers and a rather brilliant IPA. This, though, is their bread-and-butter beer – a regular lawnmower lager, which we all know is one of the toughest things to get right.\n\nIt pours straw to pale gold, with a light depth of colour. The head is initially foamy and boisterous before settling into a pleasing white crown. The nose is faint – just a hint of sweet biscuit aroma.\n\nAt first there’s a slightly crisp opening, then a gentle balance of lager flavours that provide taste but little sensation. It’s so smooth that there are no oohs and aahs as I drink it. The transitions I like to talk about aren’t there. It’s a very well-balanced, gentle lager that does everything right – so much so that I can’t say what I dislike about it, because there’s nothing I do. It doesn’t hit any highs, but it gets nothing wrong. And in the world of lawnmower beers, the most common failing is that something just doesn’t taste right. This one? Nothing tastes wrong – it’s just that the right-tasting parts are unremarkable.\n\nI do appreciate that an Estonian brewery, owned via a Finnish company rather than a global behemoth, is making its beers more widely available. A beer like this can only stand on its relative merits – and this one is relatively better than most of its competitors.\n\n77/100\n\n#nabeer #alcoholfree #alcoholfreeworld #afbeer #beer #alcoholfreedrinks",

    "text": "Estrella Damm 0.0 Alcohol Free\n\nI’ve tried beers from Damm before – this beer, in a Brit-friendly 440 ml can, is currently getting a lot of love in the UK. I’ve reviewed the 330 ml Estrella Damm Alcohol-Free before, but this one seems to have a different label. So it qualifies for a double review from me – maybe @estrelladamm_uk can confirm whether this is the same recipe as the previous Estrella Damm NA? I notice that it includes added glucose and fructose syrups, just like the NA version.\n\nThis has everything you’d expect from a well-made Spanish macro lager. In the glass it’s bright mid-gold with good clarity and strong depth of colour. The mid-white head forms a satisfying foamy cushion. The nose is gently malty.\n\nIt begins with a pronounced bitter note, tempered by obvious sweetness, which takes away the potential for a really crisp first impression. The mouthfeel is impressive at first – it helps to intensify the flavours and has my mind mentally ticking a lot of the boxes I want from a lawnmower beer. The main flavours are light cereal with a hint of that dry, light rice note fans of San Miguel will recognise.\n\nIf you guessed there was a “but” coming, you’d be absolutely right. There’s a lot to like about this beer, but I have an issue with it. My problem lies with the fructose and glucose syrup, which I can taste and feel all the way through. Once you’re aware of how cleverly added sugars can alter our perception of food, it’s hard not to be sceptical. The added sugars here give a rich mouthfeel while robbing this lager of its crisp first bite. I know this isn’t a German Pils, but I still want a lager to move from a dry, sharp opening into a slightly sweeter body. Here, that subtlety is missing.\n\nIt’s a well-made beer, and I’m going into a lot of detail about what is, after all, just a decent-tasting supermarket lager. But it’s worth explaining why a processed macro beer like this reminds me of a nice-tasting supermarket loaf of bread – and I suppose I’m a sourdough snob. Sorry, not sorry.\n\nA decent-tasting supermarket beer, but just a bit over-processed for me.\n\n77/100\n\n#nabeer #alcoholfree #alcoholfreeworld #afbeer #beer #alcoholfreedrinks",

It’s weird how your brain says, with all these things, “go on, just one.” But I’ve learned moments like this always pass, and they pass quickly.\n\nThere will always be a reason to pour a glass of vino whether it’s to celebrate or to wind down, but there are far more reasons not to. Clear head. More energy. Better sleep. Healthier body. Healthier bank account.\n\nAnd most of all, confidence.\nConfidence to grow in business, in life, in mindset.\n\nI used to think not drinking might make me boring 🤦🏼‍♀️ but it’s shown me how good life can feel without it.\n\nHere’s to 300 days of clarity, calm, and growth. For anyone who’s been thinking about cutting back, it really is worth it. 💪\n\n#AlcoholFree #300DaysSober #Mindset #GrowthJourney #HealthyHabits",

It's smooth and the fruit flavour is clear but not over powering. \n\nI enjoyed this. I couldn't drink many in a single sitting, but I'd see myself having it on a number of occassions.

    "text": "Vandestreek Playground - Here we have a non alcoholic IPA (ABV 0.5%) brewed by Vandestreek, based in the Netherlands. This brewery is new to me but first impressions were good because the bottle looks awesome! I love a good IPA but the bottle doesn’t give much away about the liquid inside. That said, before tasting, the pour was fun. Great head and an all-round beautiful, deep-looking IPA that I was excited to taste. The first thing that I noticed was the sharpness upon first sip, which remains with the drink throughout. It doesn’t taste non-alcoholic - that’s a fact. Have a try yourself and I’m confident you’ll agree. Like a lot of IPAs, it’s full of citrusy flavours, but for me, the sharpness was always the first thing I noticed every sip, slightly ruining the flavours. It’s also a tad syrupy, something I’m not a fan of. It’s a good AF IPA, and I’d happily drink again. But compared to Mash Gang Chug, it’s second best in my opinion. A good beer, but not the best beer. \n\nRating - 7/10\n\n#DryButFly #AlcoholFreeBeer #NonAlcoholicBeer #AlcoholFree #AFBeer #Sober #NoBooze #NoHangover #Beer #Lager #IPA #Stout #PaleAle #Pilsner #Review #AF #HazyPaleAle #Vandestreek #Playground",

    "text": "Mash Gang Lesser Evil - Bit of a problem here. I’m not a big stout fan (but obviously love Guinness Zero) and I really can’t stand cherries. This is a stout (ABV 0.5%) with chocolate and cherries. I’m not for a second saying it’s a bad beverage. However, as this is a personal review platform, I’m going to have to rate it at the bare minimum because unfortunately, I couldn’t finish it. However, please make sure you leave your own rating by commenting below. Mash Gang make CRACKING beverages and if you’re looking for an alcohol free stout and enjoy cherries - absolutely get yourself a can or two of Lesser Evil. However, it’s not for me, and I won’t be buying again! One thing I should add - I am absolutely not a beer expert and far from a stout drinker, but I would never have guessed this was ABV 0.5%. It tastes like a stout should (I think), but just wasn’t one I could stomach. I can highly recommend the following brews from Mash Gang (ideal if you’re like me, and aren’t a big fan of stouts, and especially cherries) - Cult (pale ale), Chug (IPA) and Glug (lager).\n\nRating - 1/10\n\n#DryButFly #AlcoholFreeBeer #NonAlcoholicBeer #AlcoholFree #AFBeer #Sober #NoBooze #NoHangover #Beer #Lager #IPA #Stout #PaleAle #Pilsner #Review #AF #HazyPaleAle #MashGang #LesserEvil",

    "text": "Mash Gang Glug - There is no shortage of alcohol free lagers in the market. However, having reviewed plenty, there is a real shortage of flavourful alcohol free lagers out there. Having tried a few Mash Gang beers now, including Cult (pale ale) and Chug (IPA), I was extremely confident that Glug (lager) would be decent, and I was right. Firstly, it smells lush! And when you pour it, the golden liquid forms a small, but authentic looking head (which disappeared before I got my photo, slightly disappointing). Taste wise - there is a lot going on. The brewers state Glug is “crisp and complex” and I’d have to agree - especially with “crisp”. As for complexity, I don’t have the sophisticated pallet I wish I had, but this beer has a hint of lime and gooseberries, and while I may not have been able to pinpoint these additions, they make for a delicious beverage! It’s seriously tasty, and with so many “mainstream” AF lagers tasting like fizzy water, this instantly stands in a class of its own. It tastes alcoholic and I am confident if you gave this to 100 lager drinkers, not many would flag it is only ABV 0.5%. Another triumph from the Mash Gang team. Skip my reviews for the rest of my beers (actually, please don’t) - if you want authentic tasting AF beers with modern twists and genuine flavour, check out @mash__gang (who don’t sponsor me in any way and there is no connection between us - I should point out in case you think I’m biased, which I’m not). I’ve got plenty of Glug in the fridge (for now). Excellent! \n\nRating 9/10\n\n#DryButFly #AlcoholFreeBeer #NonAlcoholicBeer #AlcoholFree #AFBeer #Sober #NoBooze #NoHangover #Beer #Lager #IPA #Stout #PaleAle #Pilsner #Review #AF #MashGang #Glug",

As a drinker unfamiliar with fruit beers, I thoroughly enjoyed this beer’s sweet and sour cherry balance. A good one to get in for Christmas, which would pair well with cheese. \n\n#alcoholfree #beer #fruit #alcoholfreebeer #nonalcoholicbeer #afbeer #nabeer #belgium",

I’m a big fan of lucky saint and have really enjoyed the German style beers since starting my sobriety journey so this on paper was a match made in heaven.\n\nLucky saint have knocked it out the park with this one.  Very flavoursome notes of banana and cloves slightly hazy amber beer\n\nVery tasty and enjoyable. Lucky Saint know what they’re doing with AF beers they were my first niche AF brewery that I got into outside of the standard supermarket options and their unfiltered lager is the only draft AF beer you can find in and around London so I do have a soft spot for the brand  but this is just a big box ticker.\n\nFull of flavour, zero watery notes, taste like a beer & comes in a big bottle ✅\n\n@luckysaintbeer \nWeissbier\n⚪️🔵🍺 9/10\n\n#luckysaint #luckysaintbeer #alcoholfree #alcoholfreebeer #alcoholfreelife #alcoholfreelifestyle #af #afbeer #afdrinks #sober #sobriety #soberliving #soberlife #sobrietyjourney #sobrietyinhospitality #teetotaler #teetotal #onedayatatime #odaat #beer #beerlover #beerlovers #shotoniphone",

    "text": "Mash Gang Chug - This is our second Mash Gang beverage review, after Mash Gang Cult scored our second ever 10/10. So is it any good? The answer is easy. Yes. While so many AF beers lack taste, Chug is an IPA (ABV 0.5%) bursting with hoppy, citrusy flavours. I promise you if you try this for the first time, you wouldn’t know it’s alcohol free. The beer itself looks wonderful, and just like Cult, you can smell the beautiful aromas the moment you crack open the can. Perhaps an ever so slightly unusual aftertaste, but all in all, this is another exceptional non-alcoholic beer, and @mash__gang have really opened my eyes to what an AF beer can taste like when the necessary level of love is put into the brewing process. I look forward to trying more in the near future. \n\nRating - 9.5/10\n\n#DryButFly #AlcoholFreeBeer #NonAlcoholicBeer #AlcoholFree #AFBeer #Sober #NoBooze #NoHangover #Beer #Lager #IPA #Stout #PaleAle #Pilsner #Review #AF #MashGang #Chug",

    "text": "Half way through Sober October!\n\nA lot of people have asked me two questions. \n\nWhy? Well, why not? I have been focusing hard on running this year and being in the best physical shape I can. I don’t believe that my alcohol consumption was necessarily holding back my success as I have managed to continually and consistently drop weight and run longer distances, faster. With that said, I was more so just curious to see if it would make a difference. \n\nThat leads me into the second question. Have you noticed a difference? I will admit I am sleeping significantly better. Being well rested plays a massive role in recovery and I do believe it is making me a stronger runner. I have also noticed a slight change in my body. I have managed to lose 70 pounds this year and I have noticed over the last couple weeks my skin is starting to firm up a bit and I am seeing some definition around my muscles. Now, I don’t know for sure if that is the absence of alcohol or just consistency doing its works but either way I am happy with the results. \n\nNot drinking has not stopped me for going out, having fun with my friends at bars, breweries, parties, etc. The majority of the run clubs I participate in meet and end at breweries. Many places offer up NA options such as hop water, house-made sodas, and NA beers. \n\nAs an added bonus, while my weight is down, my bank account is looking a little heavier! \n\nPictured:\n@reformationbrewery Cola. \n@variantbrewingcompany Hop Pop Hop Water\n@hornedowlbrewing HOB Tangerine Hop Water\n\n.\n.\n.\n#sober #soberoctober #nonalcoholic #nabeverages #zeroproof #alcholfree #homemadesoda #cola #hopwater #fitness #weightloss #weightlossjourney #healthyliving #nonalcoholicbeer #nonalcoholicdrink #mocktail #sleep #rest #recovery #runclub",

And not in the sense that the head recedes quicker, cause it’s served warmer. Completely flat from the very beginning and the pint should be filled with beer to the very top. Which to me seems a bit odd, mainly because of those 2 reasons: A - normally head in a beer helps you sense its aromas, be it hoppy or estric, so serving it flat would impede that sensation B - making foam helps decarbonise the beer, so it doesn’t make you feel bloated. I haven’t ever been to the UK, so idk maybe they pour it agressively and shave the foam off, which would make more sense, but it doesn’t help with the first point I made. And to make it clear - I’m genuinly curious about what would make a British style ale so different from most other styles on this front</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AMNSKY\"> /u/AMNSKY </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1oovoby/serving_darker_ales_flat/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1oovoby/serving_darker_ales_flat/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "text": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>It feels like small breweries are dying off because everyone is chasing whatever the newest hyped release is. People will line up around the block for an instagram famous hazy IPA shipped from 3 states away… but the local place making consistently good beer sits half empty. Craft beer used to be about community like knowing the staff, hanging out at the taproom, supporting places that give a neighborhood character. Now it’s become more like sneaker drops or pokémon cards. If it’s not rare, exclusive, or wrapped in flashy can art people don’t care. Meanwhile the breweries that actually rely on regulars to survive are struggling. You can’t run a business on hype alone. And you definitely can’t survive when your customers treat every beer as disposable and only show up when something “limited” hits social media. Last night after a few rounds of valorant I was thinking about how many great local spots I’ve seen close because people only want bragging rights not a place to actually sit and enjoy good beer. If we want small breweries to survive we have to support the ones right in our own backyard not just the ones that make cool labels and hype videos.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/DownvoteeDodger\"> /u/DownvoteeDodger </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1ooi3nb/were_killing_small_breweries_by_treating_beer/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1ooi3nb/were_killing_small_breweries_by_treating_beer/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "text": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I've noticed that Heineken specifically gets torn apart online way more than other similar beers in its category. People act like it's the worst thing ever made, but then they'll casually drink Budweiser or Corona like those don't taste like watered-down regret.</p> <p>They're all mass-produced lagers. They all taste pretty similar if we're being honest. But for some reason Heineken has become the punching bag while other macro brews get a pass. Is it the green bottle? The marketing? The price point?</p> <p>I'm not even a huge Heineken fan, I'll drink whatever's cold at a barbecue. But the specific hatred it gets seems disproportionate. I've seen people refuse Heineken cans at parties and then grab a Coors Light like that's somehow a massive upgrade and not just cold disappointment in a different can.</p> <p>Yeah, I've heard the whole thing about it tasting better in Europe because it's fresher there, which might be true. But people here act like American Heineken is undrinkable while giving other domestic macros a free pass for tasting like they were filtered through cardboard.</p> <p>Maybe it's because Heineken markets itself as slightly more premium so people feel like it's pretending to be something it's not? I've tried comparing them side by side and honestly can't tell enough of a difference to justify the strong opinions. Even looked at wholesale pricing on sites like Alibaba and they're all in the same range.</p> <p>What's the actual deal?

    "text": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I lived in Italy for over a year and a half, and somewhere between the espresso culture and the aperitivo hours, Peroni quietly became the beer that rewrote my taste buds.</p> <p>I wasn’t even a beer guy at first — more of a liquor drinker — but Peroni just made sense. Crisp without being sharp, clean finish, none of that overly carbonated “bloat” feeling I get from a lot of American domestic lagers. It’s the kind of beer you can drink all day during a long lunch or seaside evening without feeling weighed down or sick. There’s this balance — light enough to be refreshing, but with enough body and malt character to actually enjoy and remember.</p> <p>Coming back to the U.S., I tried going back to what everyone drinks here — Bud Light, Coors, Miller — and honestly? It’s rough. They feel fizzy rather than crisp, filling rather than refreshing, and there’s this weird artificial “processed lightness” that just doesn’t compare. Where Peroni is smooth and elegant, American light beer feels like it’s trying too hard to be light, and ends up tasting watered-down and overly carbonated instead of clean.</p> <p>Maybe it’s nostalgia, maybe it’s terroir, maybe living in Italy just spoils you — but Peroni isn’t just a beer to me. It’s a profile: restrained, crisp, refined, built for actually enjoying a day rather than powering through a tailgate.</p> <p>Anyone else feel like Italian and European lagers just have a different philosophy? Like they’re brewed for living, not just consuming?</p> <p>Edit : definitely reading through you can tell all the Americans in here butt hurt I’m pissin on American beer I’m American born and raised I know the American beers I named the most popular for my discussion but again once some one comments something they all dickride and horse back the other comment with no real meaning behind it you’ve never been out of the country it shows cause your fat ass has probably been drinking bubbly shit your whole life and it’s all you know the people that didn’t come in here and immediately start trying to find a way to be a smart ass and actually put forth meaning to the discussion thank you . </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/liilchristian\"> /u/liilchristian </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1oo7dkn/did_peroni_rewire_my_beer_brain_american_beer/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1oo7dkn/did_peroni_rewire_my_beer_brain_american_beer/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Relatively new to the whole beer thing, I didn't try one till I was 21 (am 22 now). I want suggestions as to some that I can find relatively easy (whether it be online or commonly found in stores) that people like me like! Here is my list so far:</p> <ul> <li>Budweiser: solid 5 in retrospect. Great if I go to a ball game or something</li> <li>Yuengling: 10/10, literally don't dislike anything about this!</li> <li>Coors Banquet: 10/10, if I am not drinking Yuengling its a Banquet.</li> <li>Shiner Bock: 8/10, the flavor isn't all the way there for me, but definitely a good pick every now and again</li> <li>Shiner Black: This was really good but I could only stand to have like 1 or 2 before I was tired of it. </li> <li>Corona (no lime, too lazy): 6.5/10. Good flavor, just not enough flavor</li> <li>Modelo: 8/10. Good pick. Only had on tap though</li> <li>Modelo Negra: 7/10: just kinda wanted a normal Modelo more tbh</li> <li>Weihenstephaner hefe weissbier (?): 7/10. <em>Really good flavor,</em> just expensive and the flavor gets tiring quickly, and just wind up wanting something else</li> <li>Michelob Ultra: 3/10. Water????</li> <li>Stella Artois: 3/10. Didn't care for the flavor. I can't exactly tell you why, though. </li> <li>Heineken: 7/10. I really have to be in the mood for this one. It has a distinct flavor to it that is great, but its only something I come back to every now and again. </li> </ul> <p>I'm not <em>really</em> a big fan of beer that tastes super malty. I think Budweiser is a great example, you really get that &quot;oh this is beer made from the corn I live next to&quot; feel from it.

I do not drink much alcohol (rarely) yet I want to participate in some of the social gatherings without feeling left out. I know there are many others who also feel this way.</p> <p>B. I have mentioned to people about how their fairs should offer mocktails in their beer gardens. Most have told me &quot;that will not bring in the revenue&quot; and I disagree. For one, if you aren't drinking beer you are either not in the beer garden, or you are going out of the beer garden to get soda, lemonade, etc. and I think people would be willing to pay &quot;alcohol&quot; prices for premium mocktails and NA drinks and stay within the 21+ areas.</p> <p>C. I will be hosting a mocktail experience at my trade show room next month and want to share the importance of this with people who are planning large-scale events. I also want to give out a few samples of these drinks for those who are sober.</p> <p>D. I want to create a short e-book on how to add this experience to your event and how it can help improve revenue as well as attendance.</p> <p>Am I wishful thinking here? Is any of this possible?

Imagine my joy when I saw this one in my local B&amp;M for a tenner for the gift set...I had to have it. Is it good though? Let's find out.</p> <p>Invincible pours a nice deep gold colour, slightly hazy, with a loose white head. The aroma is sweet citrus and tropical, with plenty of it to boot. The body is light to medium with high levels of vibrant carbonation. The flavour is wonderful, bitter, hoppy, with a citrus twist and a subtle pineapple suggestion to finish it off. It's well balanced with the hops and bitterness, something that makes me very happy. On the back end is where the bitterness really shines, it's slightly resinous and piney, and it's here where that lays roots on your tongue, lasting for a good time.</p> <p>So yes, this is a corker of a beer, with bags of flavour and an aggressive carbonation, much like the riffage in your typical JP track. The only thing I'd change is the body, and that would be to make it as heavy as Priest's music, but that's a tough ask for any alcohol free beer. 4.6/5 from me, with a buy again and value for money bonus.

While this isn’t an apples-to-apples comparison with real bourbons, Kentucky 74 Spiced comes surprisingly close. Spiritless labels it as a cinnamon whiskey, but it’s not the candy-cinnamon-forward style you get in Fireball or similar products. Instead, it aligns more with bourbons that feature woodsy cinnamon notes layered into a balanced profile.</p> <p>Tasting Notes:</p> <ul> <li>Charred Oak - Oak and Smoke</li> <li>Vanilla - rounded sweetness</li> <li>Caramel</li> <li>Warm Baking Spices <ul> <li>Woodsy Cinnamon Bite - noticeable but not overpowering</li> <li>Clove - adds depth and warmth</li> <li>Maybe some Nutmeg and Allspice, but subtle</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p>Overall, Kentucky 74 Spiced is well-balanced and harmonious, with its spice and sweetness seamlessly layered over a foundation of oak and vanilla. A top choice among non-alcoholic whiskeys for those seeking a bourbon-like experience.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BigBig5\"> /u/BigBig5 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nonalcoholic/comments/1nugqui/spiritless_kentucky_74_spiced_nonalcoholic/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nonalcoholic/comments/1nugqui/spiritless_kentucky_74_spiced_nonalcoholic/\">[comments]</a></span>",

So I’ve tried glen dochus. ( ughh ) and spiritless 74, which is pretty good- but no burn. I know it’s the alcohol that does it, but HP has done pretty well IMO. It’s just impossible to find its so niche ( I live in Utah) and when I do ( like Upside Down) they are always sold out. Would a cinnamon Spiritless be any good’? Ritual? What can I add to make it burn more? Jalapeños? Any spicy syrups? Any ideas?

Very refreshing on a hot summer day after mowing the lawn (or climbing a 1,500-year-old pyramid).</p> <p>Anyway I was already a fan of Best Day's Electro-Lime, which is similar, but lately I am preferring the Go Brewing Salty AF Chelada. </p> <p>Both are thirst-quenching and agreeably tart.

I've been down this road before. I've quit multiple times. 4 months here, 3 months there and failed every time. This is now uncharted territory. I knew what to expect as I've experienced the highs and lows of being sober before. This time feels much different. My mind is clearer, sharper, more aware. My body feels great. I've lost a bunch of weight and leaned out. My skin is clear. My relationships have improved ( not with my spouse. That's a whole other story ) work has improved. Where I'm struggling is, the unknown! I don't know what comes next. That's both exciting and frightening, at the same time. It feels like a reset of my life. I'm not sure what I'm trying to say exactly. Maybe, has anyone else experienced this? How did you deal with it all? What worked??

    "text": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>A while ago I posted on here that my new goal is to stop drinking alone, as opposed to trying to never drink again. For the most part, it worked. I did go out once or twice a week and drank. but never alone also also never too much. Until last night. Last night I drank a bottle of wine that I bought a few days ago. I didnt even want to, I was staring at it for like an hour and didnt drink. Its almost like I convinced myself to do it. So stupid. I think I associate drinking with getting a time out but I can have relaxing time outs without drinking, and I wasnt even relaxed while drunk lol. I suffer from maladaptive daydreaming and just want my thoughts to be quiet but Its always worse when drunk. Its honestly hopeless. its never gonna stop. Anyways, back to day 1. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SpecificAnalysis750\"> /u/SpecificAnalysis750 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ooy53y/why_did_i_do_it/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ooy53y/why_did_i_do_it/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "text": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I (31f) am also an alcoholic. I apologize in advance for the length, just want to give all the information to know if I’m overreacting. </p> <p>Some background: I’ve spent the last year and a half realizing I cannot control my drinking. </p> <p>I developed a drinking problem while living with my severely alcoholic ex. At first it was fun being with him, then we moved in and I realized how bad it was and became his caretaker and started to drink to cope with it. I really cared about him, but the ups and downs were crazy making - the way he’d go on a bender, quit life and I’d have to hold the fort. Then we learned his liver was shutting down - eventually I couldn’t do it and drinking ramped up. Then we broke up - he became abusive and I struggled with loneliness and the drinking ramped up again. I moved alone and tried to deal with it myself which I did moderately okay with until I spiraled and couldn’t afford my apartment. I moved in with my mom and utterly fell apart then put it back together - still struggling with quitting drinking. </p> <p>I started going to the gym, I had a stable job - but one I don’t like and want to change. I would be able to stop drinking for a month or two and have a slip then put it back together again for another extended stint (always believing I’d make it this time). I signed up for a self referral addiction treatment and went to regular counselling. </p> <p>I met my current boyfriend (41M) and fell in love instantly. We think similarly, work hard at what we love, same interests. The age gap in some ways is great - he was 3 months sober when we met. He has a successful business, owns his house, works from home, he makes 6x what I make an hour. </p> <p>We both fell off the wagon hard.He has been working on sobriety since his early thirties - while having a problem with drinking still feels new to me. </p> <p>My strength though seems to be staying abstinent, his seems to be the ability to stop the binge. His weakness is getting bored with abstinence and mine is stopping the binge. I struggle with alcohol in the house. We try to get enough for just one day but sometimes we get greedy and get too much. </p> <p>He is able to say “okay, that’s enough” and stop. Put it in a cupboard and forget about it. I can’t. I feel like a moth at a flame - knowing it’s there and just waiting for the go ahead when he will say “okay, yeah now I want a drink”. </p> <p>So here’s the reason for the post;</p> <p>Recently, in an unfortunate turn, we had our slip and when we ran out of drinks - which is cue to STOP. I told him, alright I’m ready to stop - he said he wasn’t ready and so I gave in and got more alcohol. (Of course, I <em>want</em> to stop, but the problem drinker in me would rather drink myself to the grave). </p> <p>Two hours later, he decided that it was a bad idea and locked up the alcohol that I got (with his money, I’ll add). The situation sucks when I slip and grab a drink when we’re supposed to not be drinking. I’m the bad guy - despite that I had full intentions not to get more alcohol but weakened my resolve when he disagreed. I’m the one who can’t help myself; except I CAN when there is no alcohol in the house. He knows full well that if it’s there - I will do almost anything to get at it and he’ll ask “did I take a drink?” And the shame when I admit that yeah… I did or that no.. but I can’t stop thinking about it is crushing. </p> <p>The way my weakness is being ignored is taking me out. The relationship that I value and care about is taking the hit as I wonder if I’m being manipulated by the locked cabinet. Knowing full well that I want to get sober but I also have the monkey on my back that just wants to dive into that cabinet. Knowing that he knows that I’m struggling with it there. It’s like postponing the inevitable give into the fact that we will be drinking again, but when? Questioning - is this a power play from him? He stopped cause the alcohol messes with his body and realizing he was doing too much - which I understand cause I had felt that way two hours before him and before we got more. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Antique_Elk_3712\"> /u/Antique_Elk_3712 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ooxynk/my_alcoholic_boyfriend_controls_my_drinking/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ooxynk/my_alcoholic_boyfriend_controls_my_drinking/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Everything seems easier when life doesn't stop every weekend after getting blackout drunk and having to spend the following days trying to piece together what happened and trying to survive the anxiety.

I think thats partly because I saw my doctor and asked for help so im medicated but also, I dont have the additional anxiety of hangxiety, and the rubbish that comes with that. Not only that, but physically I feel less sluggish and my belly doesnt feel as bloated/uncomfortable. Its only been 3 weeks, so who knows how ill feel after 3 months, but I try not ti look too far ahead and focus on 1 day at a time. Things can become so much harder to manage when you look too far ahead, so 1 day at a time is my best advice to anyone. I just wanted to share my thoughts.

I cut up my arms and legs pretty good from the fall and luckily some nice people found me. They called an ambulance and my mom (embarrassing) and I woke up a few hours later on a stretcher in the ER with vomit all over me.

I went to party at a club and met New people but just kept drinking… but before the drinking bender/episode happened. On the 6th day of being sober I noticed my old self was starting to come back. Meaning I felt normal/humble and not full of anxiety and I was able to start and maintain conversations with people while being sober and not needing to drink to fuel my social side. I thought that part of me was lost because of so many different life events that happened to me which made me sad and depressed but seeing that part of me on the 6th day of being sober has really opened my eyes and i really enjoyed being sober/clear headed and a very social guy who did not feel nervous to talk and meet new women. She even offered her number to me without me asking. This really solidifies that the old part of myself is not lost and I am very thankful for that and glad I came to this realization so I will not need or think I need to drink in order to be “fun”. That 4 day bender was not good but I discovered something about my self that was good and now i feel motivated and empowered to go even longer without drinking. Sorry for the rant but I just felt like I needed to get this off my chest and maybe it can help anyone who thinks their “fun” self can only come out when drinking.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/JelloSufficient5215\"> /u/JelloSufficient5215 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ooviih/guys_i_messed_up_and_i_drank_again_i_was_clean/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ooviih/guys_i_messed_up_and_i_drank_again_i_was_clean/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I’ve gained a ton of weight, I feel like a blob in my life, and like I haven’t progressed at all in life since I started drinking.</p> <p>When I bring up my drinking to others, they usually tell me I am not an alcoholic, but I feel like I am in many ways. For example, getting the alcohol feels like getting groceries— mandatory must do rather than a nice to have. When there was a recent liquor shortage in my area, I felt stressed about where to get it. I feel embarassed to take out my recycling with the cans making noise or people seeing the big garbage bag of it.</p> <p>I am worried about seeking external help because I work in the mental health and addictions field, so I can’t exactly go to some programs in my town because its likely I will see a colleague or a client.</p> <p>Does anyone have any thoughts or tips for me?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/KKs_Delivery_Service\"> /u/KKs_Delivery_Service </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1oouf4k/contemplative_re_stopping_drinking/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1oouf4k/contemplative_re_stopping_drinking/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Then you get to you spot grab the bottle, and my brain says we may not get this chance again for another couple of hours, so basically down the bottle then hid it with the smell of energade or coldrink.

Well I took it today for the first time and I’m lying in bed knowing I’m not drinking today, mainly because this shit has me feeling pretty damn nauseous. While I’m happy this has helped me not drink at least for today, I also had a wave of fear hit me as I truly realized the potential ramifications of this. Now my struggle with alcohol is in the system. My GP knows, my insurance knows, and I know there’s no taking this back. I’m scared and angry about how this could backfire on me going forward. Potentially not being able to get certain jobs, insurance jacking up prices or outright denying me, not being able to have certain medical procedures done, all because I’m trying to get fucking better. I hate that it’s come to this, I hate that I wasn’t able to control this on my own.

Things that you know will get you closer to where you want to be. The road to good things isn't necessarily always fun, progress is not linear. I know if I want to stay sober, I need to have some sort of purpose. Even if that's just breaking a sweat once a day for 25 minutes at a minimum with a decent average heart rate (~150+). The goal is to just show up for something and set your own parameters to stick to.</p> <p>It's been 2 weeks of daily consistency for me. I got a hold of a book called &quot;the revolutionary new science of exercise and the brain&quot; and it's pretty illuminating on why exercise has been the right choice for me as a daily accountability activity. My sleep has been much better, my energy has been much better, the mood boost I get is awesome. My anxiety and stress has significantly decreased. It's becoming a foundation to build on.</p> <p>The goal is to gradually keep adding to the accountability list. Key word is gradually. I can only handle what I can handle and integrate things one at a time. You speak a goal to someone that you're ready for, and then you commit to it. Exercise is a great first goal to choose to show up to daily. It increases your discipline, self-respect, and literally your hippocampus. This gives you the willpower needed to commit to anything else you decide you're ready to handle and show up for.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/jazzyjewels911\"> /u/jazzyjewels911 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ooto6c/stop_counting_the_days_since_youve_stopped/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ooto6c/stop_counting_the_days_since_youve_stopped/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "text": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Sober Song #326</p> <p>AMBULANCE - My Chemical Romance</p> <p>If there’s anything that’s almost as difficult to say as “I’m sorry”, I think it would be “help me”. I don’t WANT to ask for help, but sometimes it is forced. Sunday, I was driving to my parents’ for dinner with them and my brother and sister-in-law. While driving, suddenly there was a lot more road noise than usual and the wheel jerked into a small swerve…flat tire. Fuck. I pulled over and the thing was well and truly shredded, with some kind of screw visible as the obvious cause of damage. It was dark, chilly, and loud on the highway, but I texted the family to let them know what was up, then got down to the business of putting on the spare tire. Jacking the car up went fine, but I could not get three of the lug nuts off for anything. The wrench just would not fit over them and I didn’t have any additional tools. My sister-in-law had texted back asking if I needed help, and I broke out into a cold sweat realizing I did. Paranoia from all the years my brother had been actively drinking and unreliable was rising up. But he has been sober for over a year and it’s not like I had many other options anyway, so I called them. He and my sister-in-law went back to their own house (not too far from where I waited, lucky for me) to get some tools and then there they were, with lights and a wrench set and extra hands. It was quick to finish the job from there, after which they drove behind me the whole way to my parents’ house. </p> <p>To me, requesting help is not so hard for things like asking for information at work to get something done more efficiently. It is hard when it feels like there’s true vulnerability involved. This goes double if the people I ask for help are members of my family. It’s not because I don’t like them, but because I somehow internalized the idea that I’m supposed to take care of them without truly needing any support in return. It feels dangerous to rely on them, like I expect them not to be up to it and the resulting disappointment would be unbearable. I have that feeling to a greater or lesser degree toward most people in my life. I do most things fairly independently, but I often think about how nice it would be not to have to do everything. To have someone drive me home, like it says in this song, and take care of me. I’m adding it to the list now to remind myself of this incident and that when I am alone in the dark, there are people who will come get me and drive me home.</p> <p><em>Oh, oh, oh, oh (x4)</em></p> <p><em>You don’t know a thing about this life, and we are up for</em></p> <p><em>Everything it takes to prove we’re not the same as them</em></p> <p><em>And we will wear our masks again, out after dark</em></p> <p><em>'Cause we are up for everything it takes, and we are not the same</em></p> <p><em>'Cause we are not afraid</em></p> <p><em>And we are not ashamed</em></p> <p><em>And if you save my life, I’ll be the one who drives</em></p> <p><em>You home tonight</em></p> <p><em>And if I ever let you down, I’ll be the one who drives</em></p> <p><em>You home tonight</em></p> <p><em>Remember once, you walked this kind of life quietly, I’ll sleep</em></p> <p><em>Behind the wheel, and passing every face you see the first time</em></p> <p><em>Singing every piece as you walk by proving that with</em></p> <p><em>All of my mistakes, that we are not the same</em></p> <p><em>And if you save my life, I’ll be the one who drives</em></p> <p><em>You home tonight</em></p> <p><em>And if I ever let you down, I’ll be the one who drives</em></p> <p><em>You home tonight, you home tonight!</em></p> <p><em>It's driving you down, it's driving you down</em></p> <p><em>It's driving you down, it's driving you down</em></p> <p><em>It's driving you down, 'cause it's driving you down</em></p> <p><em>It's driving you, driving you down</em></p> <p><em>You don’t know a thing about this life</em></p> <p><em>And you don’t know a thing about this life</em></p> <p><em>And you don’t know a thing about this life</em></p> <p><em>'Cause you don’t know a thing about me, you don’t know a thing</em></p> <p><em>And if you save my life, I’ll be the one who drives</em></p> <p><em>You home tonight</em></p> <p><em>And if I ever let you down, I’ll be the one who drives</em></p> <p><em>You home tonight, you home tonight, you home tonight!</em></p> <p><em>'Cause it's driving you down</em></p> <p><em>'Cause it's driving you down</em></p> <p><em>'Cause it's driving you down</em></p> <p><em>'Cause it's driving you, driving you, driving you down</em></p> <p>It’s not comfortable, but I guess I have to occasionally let someone else take the wheel.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!</em></p> <p><strong>Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!</strong></p> <p>I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.</p> <p>Maybe you're new to <a href=\"/r/stopdrinking\">/r/stopdrinking</a> and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.</p> <p>It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!</p> <hr /> <p><strong>This pledge is a statement of intent.</strong> Today we don't set out <em>trying</em> not to drink, we make a conscious decision <em>not to drink</em>. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!</p> <p>What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in <a href=\"/r/stopdrinking\">/r/stopdrinking</a>, we're not ready to give up.</p> <p><strong>What this is:</strong> A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at <a href=\"/r/stopdrinking\">/r/stopdrinking</a> or have followed the pledges from the beginning.</p> <p><strong>What this isn't:</strong> A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.</p> <hr /> <p>This post goes up at:</p> <ul> <li><p>US - Night/Early Morning</p></li> <li><p>Europe - Morning</p></li> <li><p>Asia and Australia - Evening/Night</p></li> </ul> <p>A link to the current Daily Check-In post can always be found near the top of the sidebar.</p> <hr /> <p>Hi friends! Somehow I looked up and all of a sudden, the trees are red, the sky is grey, and it’s November! A lot of us are going into our first sober holiday season, and while that comes with its own peculiar set of difficulties, I find it’s also a really rewarding time to bolster and cement my sobriety. </p> <p>This can be a season of cozy familial joy, of new and old traditions, of gratitude for what we have, of reflection on our growth this past year. It can be brisk morning walks on Thanksgiving. It can be reconnecting with old friends when we go home for Christmas, knowing that we shine when we’re sober and everyone can see it. It can be donating to the local food pantry. It can be hosting a holiday craft party with girlfriends, knowing we don’t need rosé to have a blast.</p> <p><em>Now is a great time to start prepping, both mentally and physically, to set us up for success. What do you want your holiday season to look like? What can you do to help make that a reality?</em></p> <p>I’ll start: I like to stock up on delicious seasonal mocktails to make sure I’m never in danger of accepting an alcoholic drink due to lack of other options. For Thanksgiving, I’m going to bring a pitcher of fresh orange juice, apple cider, ginger beer, and lime juice, topped with orange vanilla seltzer. I’ll also bring a cooler of seltzers and NA beers. </p> <p>I love you all and I will not drink with you today! 💜🐇</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Daisy-Navidson\"> /u/Daisy-Navidson </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1oot3fv/the_daily_checkin_for_wednesday_november_5th_just/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1oot3fv/the_daily_checkin_for_wednesday_november_5th_just/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I’ve posted in here before, but small backstory is I went to rehab in the beginning of September, did 30 days, and relapsed almost immediately after. I just got out of my second stay today.</p> <p>I was in good spirits this morning, felt much better than I did when I left last time. But now I feel really rough. In the sense that the world was spinning without me, life went on, and I was stuck. I was in a bubble for about 60 days in the last 2 months. I am so embarrassed and so ashamed of the fact that I’ve gotten to this point and I’m only 24.</p> <p>I came home today to my roommate, who has been incredibly supportive and wants nothing but for me to be healthy, enjoying her time going on a walk and baking cookies with her boyfriend. I couldn’t help but think about my relationship that ended at the end of August (a very ugly ending too) and how I was at fault. My drinking had made me a horrible person. It just made me very sad. I don’t want to drink right now, but I’m scared I’m going to spiral.</p> <p>Anyways. I just needed to get that off my chest. It’s been a rough two months. I just want my life back, I’m sick and tired of being sick and tired.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/PersonalityPuzzled74\"> /u/PersonalityPuzzled74 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1oosof1/having_a_rough_time/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1oosof1/having_a_rough_time/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I’ve had posts typed out here before and I deleted them. </p> <p>I have gone from being a heavy drinker (bottle of wine a day) to a maybe moderate drinker (6-12 beers a week.) I know it’s time for the next step down because I have really been trying to focus on my health and as we know, it’s all poison. </p> <p>Well recently I have been on mounjaro for weight loss and the beer doesn’t taste good, I don’t feel as relaxed as I used to AND it makes me sick. That being said, thinking about drinking a beer still sounds appealing even though I know it’s not enjoyable. </p> <p>I’m trying to reframe how I think about it so when I start to want a beer I can remember more quickly that it makes me sick. I will only be staying on mounjaro until I lose five more pounds and so I feel like it is beneficial to help shift my feelings toward drinking while I have the medicine as an assist. </p> <p>Any tips for what helped you make the decision to get rid of alcohol completely? Even though I don’t think my drinking is as problematic as it used to be I realize that if I keep viewing it as a way to relax then it will likely be a problem again in the future. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Designer_You_5236\"> /u/Designer_You_5236 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1oortct/drinking_and_mounjaro/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1oortct/drinking_and_mounjaro/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "text": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello,</p> <p>Just wanted to say hi to everyone here. I've had a couple of 3 week stints of not drinking this year (part of a concerted effort to significantly reduce my drinking overall). I've always found days 3-10 the most difficult and here I am again! Tired. So, so tired and the brain fog...I feel so so dense! </p> <p>Anyway I've been lurking here all year and I've been reading so many different stories about why people have chosen to stop drinking and what that actually looked like in practice. Lots of winding roads, false starts and definitely not a one size fits all. </p> <p>I'm not sure if this is me stopping for good but as everyone has said, I'll just aim to not drink one day at a time. In my previous stints, I haven't managed to get past the fatigue yet. I've not had anything resembling a pink cloud and certainly no weight loss but I feel like those &quot;disappointments&quot; were my expections of the past. Or that things would change for the better really, really quick. </p> <p>I would ideally like to go a full year sober as from what I have read this seems to be a time when a lot of people can look back and see some tangible benefits (physical/emotional, brain function, cravings etc). And if like to give myself a proper opportunity to be sober.</p> <p>Anyway I just wanted to pop out of the shadows this time round and say hi and thanks to all and best wishes to all the newly sober people!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/PastPromise7702\"> /u/PastPromise7702 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ooquhl/day_3_brain_fog_hi/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ooquhl/day_3_brain_fog_hi/\">[comments]</a></span>",

No turning back, no desire to fall back into that pit of myself. But I'm not grieving her loss anymore. Turns out she was seeing another man at least during the attempted reconciliation period, if not before we even broke up. Strung me along, keeping me as an option until she decided she really wanted the new guy. Now I'm just angry. She's not the person I thought she was and there's no grieving someone who never existed. It's made things a lot easier, even if I would have liked to have thought she was different.</p> <p>My main reason here is I wanted to share something with you. My alcoholism did not warrant this kind of treatment. I my dignity was taken, my home was taken. She acted with cruelty and selfishness and even though I made mistakes, I did not deserve that, especially when I was making so many big moves to get my shit together when I realized it was a problem.</p> <p>I know the shame pokes at the back of your brain. But you are still deserving of love and empathy and no one has a right to treat you without dignity. I just wish I had understood that sooner and stopped defending what was happening to me.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Schizophrenic_Lizard\"> /u/Schizophrenic_Lizard </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ooqk3x/fun_update/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ooqk3x/fun_update/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I miss drinking wine and don’t have any NA options in the house! Just going to go to my AA meeting remote and ignore it until I get to hand it off tomorrow. In the past I probably would have sneakily drank the whole thing and hid the bottle. Just have to laugh now. </p> <p>Edit/update: Thanks everyone for your comments and well wishes! Don’t worry the temptation went away quick and I will not drink it. My friend just swung by with my ice cream so I’m enjoying that before bed (and sharing a little with the cat).

I usually make it 2 or 3 days then forget all the shit I just went through and hey would you look at that?! It’s the weekend again! Drinking is socially accepted on weekends so I’m allowed, right?! I’m on day 2 after getting too drunk and starting a fight with my SO who’s still not talking to me right now and I just really want to make it past that couple of days hump. I have kids and grew up with an alcoholic mom and god I don’t want to put them through that. My birthday is next week and I would like to spend it sober (I don’t remember the last time I did) but I honestly can’t even imagine not using my birthday as an excuse to drink. But today I’m not drinking. I recently switched family drs and they ordered bloodwork for the morning just as a new patient type thing and I’m kind of nervous to see if there’s any damage to my body from the drinking. I’ve never brought it up to drs and would prefer not to because I have kids and don’t want to be put on some list in their system or something.</p> <p>Now for my random question. I don’t drink enough to have ever had the shakes but on morning where I have drank too much the night before I wake up feeling like my entire insides are vibrating. I would imagine it’s how someone feels before they have a seizure and it freaks me out. It’s happened multiple times. Has anyone had this and WTH is it?!</p> <p>If you made it this far thanks for listening to my rambling, I don’t really have anyone to talk to about this stuff. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Dry_Eye_4321\"> /u/Dry_Eye_4321 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1oopw3s/why_cant_i_break_this_stupid_cycle_and_other/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1oopw3s/why_cant_i_break_this_stupid_cycle_and_other/\">[comments]</a></span>",
