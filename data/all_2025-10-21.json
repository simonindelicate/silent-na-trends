    "text": "Self Care is a N/A beer brand by Three Magnets Brewing from Olympia, Washington. \n\nThis is their: Shades of Green Fresh Hop Black IPA \n\nAppearance: A business casual, darker shade of khaki head that is stuck at the office overtime. While in a dark room, eyes closed — that’s the body color. When given a nice swirl, the beautiful lacing slides and then combines into a pinky size head. \n3/3 \n\nAroma: faint citrus, resinous, tropical and pine alongside hints of coffee, chocolate, caramel and toast. \n9.5/12\n\nFlavor: orange marmalade, pine, resin, caramel, hints of coffee and chocolate, alongside a bitter toast throughout and lingering. \n16/20\n\nMouthfeel: incredibly, silky, smooth and creamy voluptuous body. Only slight prickly carbonation when my tongue presses on the roof of the mouth. Wow! \n5/5\n\nOverall: I cracked this sucker open the moment it was delivered and it certainly does! I am already on my third can! Absolutely, stunning, creamy body that makes the brew go down incredibly easy! A citrus sweetness reminiscent of orange marmalade comes to mind — then cutting through in line are the resinous hops, slightly toasted/burnt bread. Cascadian Dark Ale or Black IPA — either way you name it, it’s represented excellently. \n8.5/10\n\n42 out of 50 = Excellent \n\n**If you are curious about Self Care NA Beers, inside my profile is a link for 20% off first time buyers** \n\n @3magbrewing @drinkselfcare \n\n#hangsober #hangsoberbeerreviews \n\n#craftbeer #craftnabeer #craftbeerlover #craftbrew #nacraftbeer #blackipa #darkbeer #freshhop #soberoctober #beer #beers #nonalc #nonalcoholicbeer #darkbrew #cannedbeer #nonalcoholicdrink #selfcare #drinkselfcare #nabeer #nonalcohol #nabrewery #beerreview #nabeerreviews #nonalcoholiccraftbeer #lowalcohol #lowalcoholbeer #alcholfree #alcholfreebeer",

None of the buzz.\n\n📍 Brewery: @guinness , St. James’s Gate, Dublin\n🍀 Type: Non-Alcoholic Draught Stout\n💧 ABV: 0.0 %\n🛢️ Made with: The same ingredients as classic Guinness – water, malted & roasted barley, hops and yeast.\nThe alcohol is carefully removed through cold filtration to keep that signature flavour intact.\n🌰 Style: Roasty, creamy, smooth\n\n👃 Nose\nFresh roasted coffee, cocoa powder, dark malt and a hint of caramel.\nDeep, nutty and unmistakably Guinness.\n\n👅 Palate\nVelvety and full-bodied: chocolate malt, espresso, and toffee sweetness.\nThat familiar dry bitterness rounds it off beautifully – surprisingly close to the original pint.\n\n🔥 Finish\nSmooth, short and clean.\nLingering roast notes with gentle cocoa and just a touch of creamy sweetness.\n\n📝 My thoughts:\nGuinness 0.0 is proof that flavour doesn’t need alcohol to shine.\nIt’s the same silky, roasty, satisfying experience – just with a clear head afterward.\nPerfect for weeknights, workdays, or when you want a proper pint… without consequences. 😉\n\n💡 Fun Fact:\nIt took the brewers over four years to perfect the process — using cold filtration to remove alcohol while keeping that iconic nitrogen texture and creamy head.\nYes, it still pours like the real thing – cascade and all. 🍀\n\nSláinte (even at 0.0) 🍻\n\n#Guinness #Guinness00 #NonAlcoholicBeer #DraughtStout #IrishBeer #BeerReview #DrinkResponsibly #ZeroButNotNothing #NeverHeardWhisky",

While in a dark room, eyes closed — that’s the body color. When given a nice swirl, the beautiful lacing slides and then combines into a pinky size head. \n3/3 \n\nAroma: faint citrus, resinous, tropical and pine alongside hints of coffee, chocolate, caramel and toast. \n9.5/12\n\nFlavor: orange marmalade, pine, resin, caramel, hints of coffee and chocolate, alongside a bitter toast throughout and lingering. \n16/20\n\nMouthfeel: incredibly, silky, smooth and creamy voluptuous body. Only slight prickly carbonation when my tongue presses on the roof of the mouth. Wow! \n5/5\n\nOverall: I cracked this sucker open the moment it was delivered and it certainly does! I am already on my third can! Absolutely, stunning, creamy body that makes the brew go down incredibly easy! A citrus sweetness reminiscent of orange marmalade comes to mind — then cutting through in line are the resinous hops, slightly toasted/burnt bread. Cascadian Dark Ale or Black IPA — either way you name it, it’s represented excellently. \n8.5/10\n\n42 out of 50 = Excellent \n\n**If you are curious about Self Care NA Beers, inside my profile is a link for 20% off first time buyers** \n\n @3magbrewing @drinkselfcare \n\n#hangsober #hangsoberbeerreviews \n\n#craftbeer #craftnabeer #craftbeerlover #craftbrew #nacraftbeer #blackipa #darkbeer #freshhop #soberoctober #beer #beers #nonalc #nonalcoholicbeer #darkbrew #cannedbeer #nonalcoholicdrink #selfcare #drinkselfcare #nabeer #nonalcohol #nabrewery #beerreview #nabeerreviews #nonalcoholiccraftbeer #lowalcohol #lowalcoholbeer #alcholfree #alcholfreebeer",

Damm group.\n\nThis pours dark gold with a decent crown of white foam. The nose is muted, lacking the toasted-cereal depth I’d hoped for.\n\nThe flavour opens with a gently sweet, slightly roasted malt note — and that’s pretty much the whole show. It doesn’t develop much, but nor does it collapse. Many budget supermarket lagers fail right out of the gate, so this one’s clean start is already a win. The best tostada AF beers play with darker roasted malt complexity; this one just sticks with a consistent, serviceable profile that’s superior to most supermarket offerings, if not in the same league as the best.\n\n69/100\n\n#nabeer #alcoholfree #alcoholfreeworld #afbeer #beer #alcoholfreedrinks",

Damm group since 2023.\n\nIt’s a darkish mid-gold with good clarity and a decent white head — served here in the only suitable glass I could pinch from the hotel (fortunately Kölsch glass shaped enough to pass muster for a beer review). The nose is vigorous and sweet, with that unmistakably artificial lemon scent.\n\nIt begins with a pronounced lemon note that never quite recovers from its initial intensity. Beneath that is a slightly syrupy lemonade sweetness, more like sugar than fruit, and a gentle beer character that eventually shows through. Together, they make for a drinkable but unremarkable shandy — and that’s setting the bar low.\n\n62/100\n\n#nabeer #alcoholfree #alcoholfreeworld #afbeer #beer #alcoholfreedrinks",

I had a Mandarino al Limone (mandarin syrup, lemon juice and tonic water) which was quite bland and tasted like child’s squash. My other half had a Nojito (honey syrup, lemon juice, sparkling water and mint) which was very refreshing. They also have a @crodinoofficial spritz which is what I would drink if we visit again. @luckysaintbeer is also available.\n\nPizzas were great and customisable which is always good for a fussy eater like me!\n\n#sober #alcoholfree #alcoholfreelife #alcoholfreebeer #soberliving #nonalcoholic",

Der Gailtaler ist ein alkoholfreies Helles, modern interpretiert und mit <0,5 Vol.-% Alk. gebraut. Kräftiges Gold, in der Herbstsonne funkelnd. Weißer, schön beständiger Schaum. In der Nase eine angenehme Frische, leicht grasig. Etwas Malzsüße. Erfrischend und spritzig im Antrunk. Das Mundgefühl ist weich. Moussierend. Wieder grasige, hopfige Noten. Der Körper für ein AF überraschend voll. Keine Spur von \"maischigem Alkoholfreigeschmack\". Im Abgang halbtrocken. Alkoholfrei, erfrischend und... voll... gail!

First one that did not include alcohol since being old enough to drink.\n\nIt's one of those events I had previously thought about as a day that would be better including alchohol, but decided to stay dry and the honest truth is that I loved it.\n\nNo hangover, no next day anxiety, no arguments, I didnt spend a week feeling tired and out of sorts.\nWe had Nosecco, which was lovely and really added that little celebrationary feel.\n\nThere has been more food consumed than usual, but running and football will soon burn this off.\n\nI have not yet decided what sober means to me yet...maybe I will be 99% sober, maybe I wont drink again. All I know is thay this birthday was improved by not drinking and wasn't less because of it.\n\n#sobercurious \n#sober\n#99percentsober \n#alcoholfreebeer \n#alcoholfree",

To be fair, that's been the case with most of the beers in this short #alcoholfree series.\n\nWhat does this fruit juice taste like though?! Well, like fruit. Duh. Mango for sure and passion fruit for a bit of sour. I thought pineapple for a little bit. I know it's not on the can but I try to see if I taste what is there without being influenced too much. It's thin though even if I do get lactose in the aftertaste but the main mouthfeel is...orange juice. Or juice in general.\n\nOk, that was before the second pour. Now it was thicker. Not THICC but thicker so...slightly upping the rating I thought it was going to get before.\n\nSo, I wasn't getting the peach this time. I admit that. Just like yesterday's beer it was fine but not amazing.\n\n» Free Gelato: Passionfruit, Mango & Peach by @funkyfluidbeer\n» 0.5% ABV\n» Pastry Sour\n» My Untappd rating: 3.25\n\n#bier #speciaalbier #beer #craftbeer #nonalcoholicbeer #nonalcoholic #alcoholvrij #alcoholvrijbier #alcoholfreebeer #ikpas #alkoholfrei #alkoholfreibier #beerreview #beersofinstagram #instabeer #beerstagram #beergram #beergeek #beerpic #beerphoto #beerlover #funkyfluid #freegelatopassionfruitmangopeach #funkyfluidbrewey #sourbeer #pastrysour #smoothiesour",

Also supporting @mandowncic.\n\nBrewed with Strata and Nelson Sauvin hops, Blue Balls is packed with juicy, tropical flavour and a smooth, hazy body that’s every bit as satisfying as your favourite IPA. \n\nAt just 0.5% ABV (about the same alcohol content as a banana or a pot of yogurt), it’s the perfect choice when you want all the taste without the hangover.\n\nGluten free and vegan friendly, this is a beer built for good times by the sea, after a cold-water dip or whenever you’re catching up with mates! 🍻😎\n\nAll sales during October will donate directly to Man Down, supporting men’s mental health here in Cornwall.\n\n#bellinisdelikitchen #bude #cornwall #blueballscornwall #mandown #alcoholfreebeer #hazyipa #soberoctober",

Today is a brewery that only does alcoholfree beers and are pretty high up on my list qualitywise in general. So far their IPAs were the best but this is not an IPA...\n\nOrange fruit juice, that's what it looks like. No foam after it settles down. And it smells like...passion fruit, mostly. Mango too! And finally..orange. It fits the color of course.\n\nNow taste, I get those three too. That's 3 down, 2 to go! Last one is more of a stonefruit I think, peach? Tastes a bit like it. Yeah, going with peach. I have to say I don't get number 5 though...\n\nConsistency is fine at the start but unfortunately it does have a watery note in the finish. I can't say I get much sour either other than from the fruit and salt...hmmm, slightly in the aftertaste but not a lot. More fruit there too.\n\nHmmm, ok, this is decent.

Our non-alcoholic Americano is the perfect sipper before or after dinner, designed to brighten and cleanse the palate.\n\nWe build it on a split base of two zero proof spirits: a Vermouth Rosso infused in-house with orange peel and whole cloves, bringing soft spice, gentle bitterness, and warm citrus oils; and a Milano Aperitif enriched with dried hibiscus, adding tart florals and subtle berry notes. Both spirits are packed with aromatics and botanicals that echo the complexity of the original cocktail.\n\nFor sweetness and lift, we use a house-made calamansi syrup, think a vibrant mix of mandarin, lime, and kumquat with bright tropical acidity. A dash of Polynesian Kiss bitters layers in passionfruit, spice, and subtle island florals.\n\nInstead of the traditional stir, we give it a shake and finish with a hit of CO₂ for a lively spritz. The result is a tropical, zero-proof Americano that’s refreshing, layered, and unapologetically fun.

    "text": "Half way through Sober October!\n\nA lot of people have asked me two questions. \n\nWhy? Well, why not? I have been focusing hard on running this year and being in the best physical shape I can. I don’t believe that my alcohol consumption was necessarily holding back my success as I have managed to continually and consistently drop weight and run longer distances, faster. With that said, I was more so just curious to see if it would make a difference. \n\nThat leads me into the second question. Have you noticed a difference? I will admit I am sleeping significantly better. Being well rested plays a massive role in recovery and I do believe it is making me a stronger runner. I have also noticed a slight change in my body. I have managed to lose 70 pounds this year and I have noticed over the last couple weeks my skin is starting to firm up a bit and I am seeing some definition around my muscles. Now, I don’t know for sure if that is the absence of alcohol or just consistency doing its works but either way I am happy with the results. \n\nNot drinking has not stopped me for going out, having fun with my friends at bars, breweries, parties, etc. The majority of the run clubs I participate in meet and end at breweries. Many places offer up NA options such as hop water, house-made sodas, and NA beers. \n\nAs an added bonus, while my weight is down, my bank account is looking a little heavier! \n\nPictured:\n@reformationbrewery Cola. \n@variantbrewingcompany Hop Pop Hop Water\n@hornedowlbrewing HOB Tangerine Hop Water\n\n.\n.\n.\n#sober #soberoctober #nonalcoholic #nabeverages #zeroproof #alcholfree #homemadesoda #cola #hopwater #fitness #weightloss #weightlossjourney #healthyliving #nonalcoholicbeer #nonalcoholicdrink #mocktail #sleep #rest #recovery #runclub",

Der Hopfen bringt grasig-frische, blumige Nuancen, die dem Getränk Tiefe geben.\nMundgefühl: Lebendig, erfrischend, sprudelnd wie eine feine Limonade mit Hopfencharakter.\nAbgang: Erfrischend-zitronig mit leichter Apfelsüsse und feiner Hopfenbittere – macht sofort Lust auf den nächsten Schluck.\n\n🎯 Fazit: Ein innovatives, alkoholfreies Getränk, das Bierliebhaber wie auch Limonadenfans anspricht. Das Hopfenwasser zeigt, wie vielseitig Hopfen sein kann – grasig-frisch, zitronig, mit dezentem Apfelcharme. Ideal für heisse Sommertage, nach dem Sport oder als spannende alkoholfreie Alternative.\n\n🍽️ Foodpairing\nVorspeise: Blattsalate mit Zitrusdressing oder Bruschetta mit Tomate und Basilikum\nHauptgang: Gegrilltes Gemüse, leichte Fischgerichte, Sushi oder Poulet mit Zitronenmarinade\nDessert: Zitronensorbet, Apfelstrudel mit Vanillesauce\n\n🎶 Music Pairing: „Bälpmoos“ @patentochsner 🇨🇭\n\nGrafik @sandra__zimmermann__ \n\n@braukunst_brauerei #braukunst #braukunstbern #braukunsthopfenwasser #hopfenwasser #erfrischungsgetränk #alkoholfreieserfrischungsgetränk #nonalcoholicsoftdrink #hoppywater #hoppedwater #hopwater #acquadiluppolo #eaudehoublon #foodpairing #musicpairing #swisscraftbeer #schweizercraftbier #beerrocks_switzerland #beerrocks #bierliebe #biersommelier #beersommelier #diplombiersommelier #swissbeer #schweizerbier #beertasting #biertasting #untappd #pintplease @schweizerbier @untappd @beertasting.club @pintplease #beertime #beermoment",

Unfortunately it got broken back then.</p> <p>She sometimes still talks about how she wishes she still had that glass. Naturally I would love to find a replacement for her however I can't seem to remember the name of the beer it came with.</p> <p>All I remember it was a pint style glass, very heavy and with thick glass. On the glass there was a relief of an island (so not printed on). The beer bottle was tropical themed and I think it was either an IPA or a blonde beer. </p> <p>Any help would be awesome!

It's still enjoyable, but I love carbonation so it definitely felt like it was missing something. Decided to try the extra stout because it's carbonated and WOW. This might be my favorite beer of all time.

I do not drink much alcohol (rarely) yet I want to participate in some of the social gatherings without feeling left out. I know there are many others who also feel this way.</p> <p>B. I have mentioned to people about how their fairs should offer mocktails in their beer gardens. Most have told me &quot;that will not bring in the revenue&quot; and I disagree. For one, if you aren't drinking beer you are either not in the beer garden, or you are going out of the beer garden to get soda, lemonade, etc. and I think people would be willing to pay &quot;alcohol&quot; prices for premium mocktails and NA drinks and stay within the 21+ areas.</p> <p>C.

Imagine my joy when I saw this one in my local B&amp;M for a tenner for the gift set...I had to have it. Is it good though? Let's find out.</p> <p>Invincible pours a nice deep gold colour, slightly hazy, with a loose white head. The aroma is sweet citrus and tropical, with plenty of it to boot. The body is light to medium with high levels of vibrant carbonation. The flavour is wonderful, bitter, hoppy, with a citrus twist and a subtle pineapple suggestion to finish it off. It's well balanced with the hops and bitterness, something that makes me very happy. On the back end is where the bitterness really shines, it's slightly resinous and piney, and it's here where that lays roots on your tongue, lasting for a good time.</p> <p>So yes, this is a corker of a beer, with bags of flavour and an aggressive carbonation, much like the riffage in your typical JP track. The only thing I'd change is the body, and that would be to make it as heavy as Priest's music, but that's a tough ask for any alcohol free beer. 4.6/5 from me, with a buy again and value for money bonus. Now, off to see if I can buy the beer on its own.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/All-Hail-The-Ale\"> /u/All-Hail-The-Ale </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://youtube.com/watch?v=eQ-Q5ySVX7Q&amp;si=NC6l7h8Rr9h-aq1V\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nonalcoholic/comments/1nx60ss/williams_bros_x_judas_priest_invincible_af_ipa/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>",

    "text": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I’ve tried many non-alcoholic whiskey alternatives, but most lack the layered flavors I look for in a bourbon. While this isn’t an apples-to-apples comparison with real bourbons, Kentucky 74 Spiced comes surprisingly close. Spiritless labels it as a cinnamon whiskey, but it’s not the candy-cinnamon-forward style you get in Fireball or similar products. Instead, it aligns more with bourbons that feature woodsy cinnamon notes layered into a balanced profile.</p> <p>Tasting Notes:</p> <ul> <li>Charred Oak - Oak and Smoke</li> <li>Vanilla - rounded sweetness</li> <li>Caramel</li> <li>Warm Baking Spices <ul> <li>Woodsy Cinnamon Bite - noticeable but not overpowering</li> <li>Clove - adds depth and warmth</li> <li>Maybe some Nutmeg and Allspice, but subtle</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p>Overall, Kentucky 74 Spiced is well-balanced and harmonious, with its spice and sweetness seamlessly layered over a foundation of oak and vanilla. A top choice among non-alcoholic whiskeys for those seeking a bourbon-like experience.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BigBig5\"> /u/BigBig5 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nonalcoholic/comments/1nugqui/spiritless_kentucky_74_spiced_nonalcoholic/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nonalcoholic/comments/1nugqui/spiritless_kentucky_74_spiced_nonalcoholic/\">[comments]</a></span>",

So I’ve tried glen dochus. ( ughh ) and spiritless 74, which is pretty good- but no burn. I know it’s the alcohol that does it, but HP has done pretty well IMO. It’s just impossible to find its so niche ( I live in Utah) and when I do ( like Upside Down) they are always sold out. Would a cinnamon Spiritless be any good’? Ritual? What can I add to make it burn more? Jalapeños? Any spicy syrups? Any ideas?

Very refreshing on a hot summer day after mowing the lawn (or climbing a 1,500-year-old pyramid).</p> <p>Anyway I was already a fan of Best Day's Electro-Lime, which is similar, but lately I am preferring the Go Brewing Salty AF Chelada. </p> <p>Both are thirst-quenching and agreeably tart. But the Go Salty AF is more intense: a burst of sour and salt. Not for everyone, but I love it. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/RonPalancik\"> /u/RonPalancik </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/p10elgtpfmkf1.png\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nonalcoholic/comments/1mxfqst/chelada_comparison/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>",

I wanted to update it, and thought I would crowd source in case I'm missing anything - I've ranked Kava Haven as the best, followed by Sentia, Dromme and bonbuz. I did include a few cbd-mocktails because it's technically still a buzz without alcohol. Any suggestions on new stuff out there that actually makes you feel something? (note: when I say buzz, I mean body buzz and not head buzz). Thanks everyone!<br /> (P.S.

Not the kind that takes place in a gallery with carefully positioned lighting and big price tags. The kind with a mixture of performance art, interactive displays, and music that is held near abandoned buildings down by the river. I went to see some people I know from AA play with their band. After watching their performance, I walked around to check out what all the other artists were doing. I came across a small set that was lit up and covered in shiny material. The artist there had scheduled times to give short performances set to music, so I came back for the next one on the list. Their costume was all white, a dress with a wire frame attached plus a headdress that covered most of their face and had a sunburst of spikes all around it. They did a sort of dreamy dance and lip-sync to music while moving in front of the shiny backdrop. I was coincidentally wearing all black and felt almost like I was part of the performance, standing still in the darkness as the counterweight to all that white, light, and movement. I spoke to the artist briefly afterward and asked what they were thinking about while performing. They said it had a lot to do with their sobriety. I told them about my own sobriety “art”: my list of songs and brief writings about what the songs meant for me. I also asked the song title and artist so I could look it up to listen again.

I was just &quot;other&quot; from them. And this &quot;otherness&quot; made me so self-conscious.</p> <p>And, oh buddy, do I remember how it felt like alcohol just washed that otherness right off of me and I suddenly felt like I belonged. My entire 20s is dominated with me partying it up with acquaintances and strangers, comfortable because of the bottle in my hand and the booze in my stomach.</p> <p>With this mindset and experience, sobriety was daunting. I've said it a bunch in these posts, but one of my greatest fears was how I would navigate social situations, let alone life, with out alcohol to make me feel like I belonged.</p> <p>One of the first places I felt I belonged, <em>truly</em> belonged, was here at <a href=\"/r/stopdrinking\">/r/stopdrinking</a>. Sobernauts on this subreddit spoke as though they were telling my story, reading my mind, feeling my feelings. It was incredible and like nothing I'd ever experienced before and it gave me the courage to venture into sobriety.</p> <p>Since then, I've slowly found other places I feel I belong and, as I'm getting older, finding that I'm also increasingly ok with not always belonging. It can be ok to be different and if I ever need to ground myself in feeling a sense of belonging, I always have <a href=\"/r/stopdrinking\">/r/stopdrinking</a>.</p> <p>So how about you?

Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at <a href=\"/r/stopdrinking\">/r/stopdrinking</a> or have followed the pledges from the beginning.</p> <p>**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories.

I saw some news headlines about AWS being down and affecting a lot of the internet. Things seem to be good now, so hopefully no more issues. :)</p> <p>On to my Tuesday thoughts.. </p> <p>When I decided to quit drinking, I actually had the thought, “who am I without alcohol?” My second thought was, if that’s my first question, I’m probably making the right decision by quitting. I was so concerned with who I’d be without it, I didn’t even realize all of the things it had taken from me. </p> <p>A lot of my identity was wrapped up in alcohol. I had been a regular at multiple bars for the better half of 15 years, and most of my friends and social life revolved around bars and events at bars. But as we know, all of that drinking had just made me disconnected, numb, and at the end there, plain boring. I thought I was the life of the party, but in reality, I was the girl who had lost herself. I was no longer doing any of the things that I really loved about life. I stopped spending time outside. Stopped seeing my family. Slowly lost interest in hobbies that I once used to obsess over. I thought I was “living the dream” but as it turns out, I had been stripped of anything resembling a dream. </p> <p>I’ve spent the last 10 months trying to shift the to the perspective of who I am without alcohol. I’m passionate. Creative. Understanding. Driven. Motivated. Not lazy, like I had assumed I was. Much more loving than I thought. I try and remind me of these things on days when the cravings hit hard and I wonder if this is worth it. It totally is. </p> <p>Who are you without alcohol?</p> <p>What has sobriety given you that alcohol took?</p> <p>This isn’t easy, but nothing worth having ever is. And this is worth everything to me. </p> <p>Happy Tuesday, friends. </p> <p>I will not drink with you today. 🌻</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/desertqueeeen\"> /u/desertqueeeen </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1oc3sh8/the_daily_checkin_for_tuesday_october_21st_just/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1oc3sh8/the_daily_checkin_for_tuesday_october_21st_just/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I’ve always been a person who likes to drink and doesn’t want to stop but had it “under control” until the relationship ended traumatically and I went off the deep end and had a bender that lasted several months. It got to the point where I was waking up with random bruises and vomiting blood. </p> <p>One day I had a hangover from hell and the depression and stress that followed made me never want to drink again. I’ve used this subreddit so much. It’s saved me from drinking many times reading other people’s stories and realizing it can get worse.</p> <p>Since then, I started aggressive therapy, running and ran a marathon with another one coming next month. I’ve lost 50 pounds and my health has never been better. I sleep better. I don’t look gross. I don’t smell. People can notice the change. </p> <p>I’ve also started a new job that I wouldn’t have been able to have done while drinking the way I was. People can rely more on me and I have less work-related anxiety that keeps me from attempting this new role that I would never have even attempted before. </p> <p>You think it should be so obvious that I should continue to not drink but yet I just miss it so much right now. I haven’t had urges since the beginning. I don’t want to get drunk like I used to I just want to drink like a normal person and go on dates without feeling anxious. I haven’t been able to date since. It’s incredibly hard to date already but even harder when you don’t drink. I’ve lost confidence and drive. I just don’t care anymore. </p> <p>Just venting.

    "text": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Long read.....my marriage had been going south for so many reasons for a long time. Started burying that frustration in booze which I'm sure a lot of us know turns into anger. I won't lie, I had been a shitty husband for a couple years in a lot of ways. As time went on drinking got to be more and more. We had done a separation and I fell deep in the drink, minimum 15 a day. We moved back in and I had one decent stretch of 60 something days but seeing as we couldn't have tough conversations without us both getting defensive I went right back into drinking but still lesser than my worst. Well october 20 2024 she told me she was done and man I've never been such a mess. Never been so devastated and hurt in my life. Moved back to my home state and went right back to a 12 pack a night most nights, wake up all night and drink to pass back out. Finally started moving on and trying new things, mostly skydiving, and meeting new people. Well july 9th or 10th decide skydive hungover or still buzzed sucks so I quit drinking and started processing so much. Set my target date for the one year anniversary of her being done. We'll that day is now and I'm at 102 days. Everything has gone so terrible today. I was a bit in the feels, messed up a big task at work today, accidently broke my phone, not having a date to work for had me itching for a drink all day, got that bad bad craving so went for a drive, well blew apart something I thought I had fixed, ten minutes later another more expensive part broke, and then cherry on top I ran into this other girl I had dated for a few months I had been falling for and she was with her now fiance. Just feel like the universe had it out for me. I'm not gonna go buy beer tonight and I don't really know why exactly. </p> <p>Tldr...alcohol greatly sped up the end of my marriage, Set the anniversary of it ending as my target date of sobriety, hit that date and the universe suckered punched me all day. Not feeling accomplished with goal, not saying I want a drink but don't really not want to now. I don't really want to stay sober just for health, dates, etc. Idk maybe it's just a depressing day and do actually want to go back to it idk.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok_Reward1356\"> /u/Ok_Reward1356 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1oc1ub5/hit_my_target_datestruggling/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1oc1ub5/hit_my_target_datestruggling/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "text": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>For years I told myself I had it under control. That I just needed more willpower. But one random Tuesday night changed everything.</p> <p>My neighbour across the street had a new BMW courtesy car in his drive. (I love cars) I walked over, said hi, and admired it. He smiled, tossed me the keys and said, “Go on, take it out for a spin.”</p> <p>But I couldn’t, could I? Because it was 7pm… and I’d already finished a full bottle of wine, on a Tuesday! </p> <p>I panicked. Said I’d had “a couple of glasses to celebrate some good news” (total lie, I just didn’t want him to smell it on me). So he drove instead. I felt so uncomfortable, so embarrassed by myself. The whole drive, I couldn’t think about the car just about how disgusting and ashamed I felt. I told myself, “That’s it. I’m done.”</p> <p>Of course, I wasn’t. I drank again the next day. And the next. </p> <p>I did try to quit… so many day ones but always told myself I could drink in moderation… another lie! </p> <p>But that night stuck, always in the back of my mind. It was the moment I started to see alcohol for what it really was not a friend, not comfort, not fun. Just poison. Now I’m sober. I made it to 60 days recently before my holiday (then I thought again that I could drink in moderation), and I’m back on day 19 again. It’s not easy, I mess up but this time I’m determined. Every time I walk past alcohol, I say “poison” under my breath and keep going.</p> <p>But it was that original Tuesday night that was my first wake-up call. The one that I’ll never forget… </p> <p>But sobriety isn’t a straight path is it…? It was a recent holiday which was the final wake up call for me when I drank so much the first night the following days were ruined with anxiety and depression all because of my drinking. I was so bad I returned home early. My head held down with shame. What a mess, 44 years old and this is where I was! That was the moment I said enough is enough. </p> <p>If you’re struggling right now I get it. I hated myself so much. But that self-hate fades, I promise. One day you’ll just know it’s time. And when it is, peace starts to replace the chaos. It’s not an easy journey but it’s way better than the one fuelled with alcohol. So it’s day 19 today! </p> <p>IWNDWYT</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/CalmIntroduction6212\"> /u/CalmIntroduction6212 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1oc1p7x/what_finally_made_me_give_up_alcohol/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1oc1p7x/what_finally_made_me_give_up_alcohol/\">[comments]</a></span>",

My girlfriend was sending me many bad messages this holiday and I think her anger made me depressed. She kept saying I will fuck up this trip and I am alcoholic and it made me weak minded.

Back before the pandemic, I would actually go to bars and drink moderately and try out a lot of interesting and limited-run beers and stuff like that. After though, I mostly just sat around my house drinking whatever swill I could find cheap from stores within stumbling distance of my house. I'm getting back into drinking more varied and unique beers again, and actually savoring them rather than going through 12 in a night, and it's been a nice return. One of the things I thought I was giving up forever when I got sober were nice tasty beers, but the NA scene is really developing... As fewer and fewer people drink (or drink heavily), I'm excited to see them evolve even more!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Kraubinator\"> /u/Kraubinator </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1oc0v1v/sampling_beers_again/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1oc0v1v/sampling_beers_again/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I finally asked my partner for serious help facing my feelings and getting over this, and they decided to do it with me. We dumped all the booze down the drain together. Took a walk together.

This time I decided to seek medical assistance and ended up at detox/rehab and now at a PHP program. I’m done at the end of the month (was thinking of extending another month but now I’m not so sure) and I’m just losing steam. I don’t want to return to drinking, granted I am working through those urges and thoughts. My issue seems to be with the PHP program and seeing it through to the end. I am just so bored here. I am exhausted by the monotonous schedule that never changes day in and day out. The staff here looked at me like I was saying something crazy when I explained I was struggling with the “ground hog” day effect this program has. I’m feeling depressed, irritated, stalled in my therapy, and like no real progress has been made other than staying sober. I’m confused about my mental health diagnoses since the detox/rehab facility changed all my medications and “denied” some of the diagnoses I came in there with, now I’m at the PHP (separate facility) and they say they don’t agree with what the detox/rehab facility did. I’m convinced there is something missing/wrong like ADHD with my hyperactive nature or a Bipolar Disorder with how quickly/frequently I go from happy to depressed. I’m at the point where I am feeling uncomfortable, having a hard time trusting that I will be heard properly, or that there is much hope. While I live at a sober house, I was granted access to my car during the day. I am already going through plans of how I could drive to the clinic tomorrow for group sessions in the event I feel like I want leave I can. I’m ranting and just looking for any support. Looking for any reason not to just leave tomorrow morning at the first sense of uncertainty.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/LogicG\"> /u/LogicG </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1obyzq5/day_60_at_php_losing_my_drive/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1obyzq5/day_60_at_php_losing_my_drive/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Last week, I got fired at work over &quot;suspicions&quot; of me drinking on the job. </p> <p>They had absolutely no proof of me drinking at all, and it was ironic because I had actually managed to cut all of the way down to only drinking once a week. I got really upset. I mean, I was hitting all of my objectives, my coworkers and clients were pleased with my work and I actually was NOT DRINKING. They got rid of me like I was an old piece of meat. I was mortified, embarrassed and disgusted at myself. I was already questioning my relationship with alcohol, which is why I was cutting down in the first place, but the fact that my job brought it up made me feel even worse. </p> <p>So last night, I was at a party (a surprise party for me) and I drank a lot of tequila. It felt like a self-fulfilling prophecy - since I felt like people were already assiming that I was an alcoholic, why not act like one. I had a great time... but then I saw my reflection in the mirror on the way home and it wasn't a pretty sight. I made the decision then and there to quit. I also woke up with chest pains that I only get after a night of heavy drinking. Although I know in my heart that I wasn't drinking on the job, I also know that alcohol is not my friend either.

I bought a beer because I just wanted one and it was right before the gas station would stop selling alcohol. It was my way of justifying one beer because then I wouldn't be able to buy more. Thank god for some reason after I bought that I just didn't feel like drinking it. The thought of regret and dissapointment in myself outweighed my urge. I felt fine after and just left it in my car to play video games inside my house.</p> <p>Im down 6 pounds from my diet plus exercise in 2 weeks. Pants are fitting looser. Doing a diet seems to help me not want to drink since I am tracking calories. Just seeing how many calories are in a beer just makes me say no as well. My joints and mental clarity are getting better everyday. Stomach still isnt fully healed but it is getting there. Atleast I don't have bloat anymore. My gout is completely gone as well</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Imaginary-Ad7806\"> /u/Imaginary-Ad7806 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1obx2u9/bought_beer_but_didnt_drink_it/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1obx2u9/bought_beer_but_didnt_drink_it/\">[comments]</a></span>",

But the flavor always stick with me, this cloying fake melon abomination that left a bad aftertaste and I never forgot it. </p> <p>Flash forward to today, I've found some cheap discontinued energy drinks at the dollar store. There's a watermelon lime flavor game fuel thing and I'm thinking this could taste like the <em>also</em> -discontinued watermelon lime Venom energy drink. Brought a couple home (and some faygo cuz I'm a cotton candy maniac), chilled em, opened one up...</p> <p>It tastes just like that damn spiked melon drink. Exactly the same, only with 300mg caffeine instead of alcohol. I couldn't stomach it. I am glad it was only a cheap dollar store drink cuz I threw it out. There's just some combo of that flavor and the chemicals in my brain that make my skin itch.</p> <p>Does anyone else have this affiliation with flavors? I also can't stand whiskey or bourbon flavors. Immediately makes me think of drinking which makes me feel incredibly sick. I think that's a good thing. I haven't drank since my drinking buddy died at 33. He drank much more than I did and I'm 5 years older than him.</p> <p>Sorry for rambling.

    "text": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Two years ago I came clean to my husband about my secret drinking and came here for help. From him and the people here I found the support to get and stay sober.<br /> My own health was failing and I was scared but another factor was my little brother. He’d recently found he had multiple organs in or near failure and wasn’t expected to live much longer. Drugs and alcohol had ravaged his body and alcohol was ravaging mine. I was scared of dying.<br /> October 20 is his birthday. His seemingly sealed fate was at the front of my mind in the days leading up to October 20. His birthday was a good day to decide to quit and start living again.<br /> I wish I could have told him but I couldn’t. There was so much hurt and trauma we shared and his rage made communication unsafe. Today is his birthday and it is the first since he died last November. It’s a really difficult day. My life has changed so much. I’m healthier and happier and have taken up hiking where I spend hours taking in the beauty all around and appreciating the life I have. I’m missing my brother terribly and would give anything for things to have turned out differently but I know that’s not possible. What was possible was for things to turn out differently for me and they have.<br /> Thank you to the community here and the collective strength that is given to help give people struggling that boost to help us keep going. I’m proud of myself and proud of all of us here doing our best.

I think the biggest thing ive learnt this past year is controlling my emotions and learning to cope without using alcohol as obviously that was only making things worse. One thing I’m still struggling with is the need to always have a beverage with me because I always had a drink with me no matter where I was, a bit like quitting smoking and needing something to do with your hands, I do drink a lot of water now so that’s a benefit.

I also just celebrated my true first sober birthday, last year I had a stint of sobriety but was a sober drunk. After dealing with a divorce, losing my studio, seizure, ICU, inpatient, outpatient, and sober living, steps with my sponsor, I’m finally actually LIVING my life. I’m giving my life a facelift honestly. So far I’ve gotten a “get well” job, gotten a new e-bike since I crashed my old one while drunk (go figure) going to the department of rehabilitation for school, and worked on myself spiritually, mentally, and physically. It needed to pan out the way it did. I’ve come such a long way in every sense of the word. I’m just a happier human all around. I love it. Getting family and friends trust back, writing amends and meeting new people has meant the world to me. So if you’re thinking about starting your sober journey- do it, it’s worth it. It’s good to be here. 10/10 would recommend.
